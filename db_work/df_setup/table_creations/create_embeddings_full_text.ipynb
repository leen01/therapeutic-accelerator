       " Document(page_content='Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disease associated with spinal inflammation and bony fusion of the spine that leads to functional impairment [1]. Radiographic damage of the spine can be quantified by the modified stoke AS spine score (mSASSS) [2]. Although tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) blockade has been shown to reduce active inflammation in AS patients, the previous clinical trials of TNF-α blockade showed discordant results in pre-Background/Aims: For patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), golimumab has consistent efficacy in controlling disease activity over 5 years but its benefit in preventing radiographic progression was less clear at 4 years. To predict radiographic progression, we analyzed the baseline characteristics of AS patients in a Korean population. Methods: Sixty-eight Korean patients with AS participated in the phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (GO-RAISE) which has previously been described. Baseline modified stoke AS spine score (mSASSS) and change in mSASSS from baseline (ΔmSASSS) until week 208 were analyzed in the Korean patients enrolled in the GO-RAISE study. Results: Although Korean patients had lower baseline mSASSS compared to non-Korean patients and received active management, radiographic progression was not prevented. Korean patients who did not undergo radiographic progression of spinal lesions of AS were younger and had shorter symptomatic duration, lower Bath AS functional and metrology indices, better chest expansion, and lower baseline mSASSS. The baseline mSASSS and ΔmSASSS were positively correlated in Korean AS patients (p < 0.001). Radiographic progression was more prevalent (80.0%) when baseline mSASSS > 10 and less common (13.0%) with baseline mSASSS = 0. Conclusions: In Korean AS patients, radiographic progression of the spine after 4 years was predicted effectively by the initial severity of the spinal lesion(s) in patients treated with golimumab.', metadata={}),\n",

Golimumab, a human monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody, was evaluated successfully by the randomized controlled trial GO-RAISE (multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial), which demonstrated the consistent efficacy of golimumab over 5 years in terms of function, disease activity, and spinal mobility [8]. However, the benefit of golimumab over placebo in preventing radiographic progression was unclear at 4 years because the patients in the placebo group crossed over to the golimumab 50 mg group at week 24 due to ethical concerns.\\n\\nAfter following the patients with AS who received golimumab for more than 3-and-a-half to 4 years in Korea, we had a clinical impression that our patients could be divided into two groups based on radiographic progression. Indeed, in infliximab users, radiographic damage at baseline was suggested as a predictor for radiographic progression [3]. In the Korean population, several factors, including baseline mSASSS and peripheral joint disease, were proposed to be associated with radiographic progression in previous studies [9,10]. However, these retrospective studies were not able to draw definite conclusions about the factors predictive for radiographic progression.\\n\\nTo investigate the reason for these outcomes, we tried to analyze baseline characteristics and to suggest factors predictive for radiographic progression in Korean patients with AS who were enrolled in the GO-RAISE trial.', metadata={}),\n",

As the mean ΔmSASSS of 'ΔmSASSS ≤ 0' group was −0.56 ± 1.39 and 'ΔmSASSS > 0' group was 7.22 ± 6.62 in Korean patients, ΔmSASSS = 0 could be a useful parameter for separating non-progressors from progressors. Sex, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, smoking, baseline level of C-reactive protein, disease duration before diagnosis, Bath AS disease activity index, and patients' general assessment of back pain and disease activity were not significantly different between progressors and non-progressors.

       " Document(page_content=\"the clinical course during the trial, radiographic progression was not prevented as a result of treatment with golimumab. Ironically, the baseline characteristic with the highest predictive value was baseline mSASSS. Most of the progressors (ΔmSASSS > 0) had a higher baseline mSASSS (> 10) and most of the non-progressors (Δm-SASSS ≤ 0) had no radiographic damage initially. This 'all-or-none' phenomenon could be explained by the hypothesis that early spinal lesions may resolve completely after effective suppression of inflammation with TNF-α blockade [11,12]. Previous studies considered two units or more of mSASSS change (ΔmSASSS ≥ 2) as significant change [7,13]. In light of our results, the criteria we set (baseline mSASSS = 0, ΔmSASSS > 0) were more meaningful for predicting progression because a single bone lesion on X-ray could indicate the existence of other reversible spinal lesions, not detectable by X-ray but which could be detected by magnetic resonance imaging [12]. Our findings also support previous results that showed early initiation and longer use of TNF-α blockade was effective in preventing radiographic progression [14]. As a Korean population is relatively homogeneous in ethnicity, subgroup study can be valuable. Indeed, the predominant subtype of HLA-B27 of Korean AS patients was HLA-B*2705, unlike other Asians [15]. The previous retrospective studies on the clinical characteristics of Korean patients with AS focused mainly on the higher prevalence of juvenile onset AS and peripheral arthritis and the association between the presence of peripheral arthritis and slow radiographic progression [9,10,16,17]. Younger age was shown to be a favorable factor for radiographic progression, but the influence of peripheral arthritis was still controversial [18].\", metadata={}),\n",

Therefore, the results of this study cannot be generalized to Asian ethnicity. (2) Because of the smaller size of the study population the statistical power was weaker than for the original study. However, a consistent tendency was noted when comparing baseline mSASSS and ΔmSASSS in Korean and non-Korean populations. (3) The natural course of disease in Korean AS patients could be different from that in golimumab users. In addition, as in the original study, the true effect of golimumab itself was uncertain because all the patients initially belonging to the placebo group (22% of the total study population) crossed over to golimumab groups during the study [8]. Therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution, recognizing these limitations related to the study population.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Korean patients with AS involved in the randomized controlled trial receiving golimumab for up to 4 years had distinctive patterns of spinal lesion progression detected by simple radiographs at week 208.

       " Document(page_content='Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic rheumatic disease associated with spinal inflammation and bony fusion of the spine that leads to functional impairment [1]. Radiographic damage of the spine can be quantified by the modified stoke AS spine score (mSASSS) [2]. Although tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) blockade has been shown to reduce active inflammation in AS patients, the previous clinical trials of TNF-α blockade showed discordant results in pre-Background/Aims: For patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), golimumab has consistent efficacy in controlling disease activity over 5 years but its benefit in preventing radiographic progression was less clear at 4 years. To predict radiographic progression, we analyzed the baseline characteristics of AS patients in a Korean population. Methods: Sixty-eight Korean patients with AS participated in the phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial (GO-RAISE) which has previously been described. Baseline modified stoke AS spine score (mSASSS) and change in mSASSS from baseline (ΔmSASSS) until week 208 were analyzed in the Korean patients enrolled in the GO-RAISE study. Results: Although Korean patients had lower baseline mSASSS compared to non-Korean patients and received active management, radiographic progression was not prevented. Korean patients who did not undergo radiographic progression of spinal lesions of AS were younger and had shorter symptomatic duration, lower Bath AS functional and metrology indices, better chest expansion, and lower baseline mSASSS. The baseline mSASSS and ΔmSASSS were positively correlated in Korean AS patients (p < 0.001). Radiographic progression was more prevalent (80.0%) when baseline mSASSS > 10 and less common (13.0%) with baseline mSASSS = 0. Conclusions: In Korean AS patients, radiographic progression of the spine after 4 years was predicted effectively by the initial severity of the spinal lesion(s) in patients treated with golimumab.', metadata={'corpusid': 19069287, 'title': 'Baseline extent of damage predicts spinal radiographic progression in Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with golimumab', 's2fieldsofstudy': ['Medicine'], 'authors': [{'authorId': '77537957', 'name': 'J.

Golimumab, a human monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody, was evaluated successfully by the randomized controlled trial GO-RAISE (multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial), which demonstrated the consistent efficacy of golimumab over 5 years in terms of function, disease activity, and spinal mobility [8].

       " Document(page_content=\"the clinical course during the trial, radiographic progression was not prevented as a result of treatment with golimumab. Ironically, the baseline characteristic with the highest predictive value was baseline mSASSS. Most of the progressors (ΔmSASSS > 0) had a higher baseline mSASSS (> 10) and most of the non-progressors (Δm-SASSS ≤ 0) had no radiographic damage initially. This 'all-or-none' phenomenon could be explained by the hypothesis that early spinal lesions may resolve completely after effective suppression of inflammation with TNF-α blockade [11,12]. Previous studies considered two units or more of mSASSS change (ΔmSASSS ≥ 2) as significant change [7,13]. In light of our results, the criteria we set (baseline mSASSS = 0, ΔmSASSS > 0) were more meaningful for predicting progression because a single bone lesion on X-ray could indicate the existence of other reversible spinal lesions, not detectable by X-ray but which could be detected by magnetic resonance imaging [12]. Our findings also support previous results that showed early initiation and longer use of TNF-α blockade was effective in preventing radiographic progression [14]. As a Korean population is relatively homogeneous in ethnicity, subgroup study can be valuable. Indeed, the predominant subtype of HLA-B27 of Korean AS patients was HLA-B*2705, unlike other Asians [15]. The previous retrospective studies on the clinical characteristics of Korean patients with AS focused mainly on the higher prevalence of juvenile onset AS and peripheral arthritis and the association between the presence of peripheral arthritis and slow radiographic progression [9,10,16,17]. Younger age was shown to be a favorable factor for radiographic progression, but the influence of peripheral arthritis was still controversial [18].\", metadata={'corpusid': 19069287, 'title': 'Baseline extent of damage predicts spinal radiographic progression in Korean patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with golimumab', 's2fieldsofstudy': ['Medicine'], 'authors': [{'authorId': '77537957', 'name': 'J.
