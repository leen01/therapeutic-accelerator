       " 'documents': ['Pathological worrying is of high transdiagnostic relevance and is related to maladaptive emotion regulation processes. Dysfunctional emotion regulation and its underlying neural mechanisms might contribute to the maintenance of fear over time. Therefore, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aims at investigating the association of trait worry with neural correlates of emotion regulation. Twenty-six healthy females were instructed to passively look at aversive pictures, to distract themselves with a neutral thought, or to down- and up-regulate negative feelings via cognitive reappraisal in response to repeatedly presented aversive pictures. Trait worry was not related to cognitive reappraisal but to distraction, which leads to a greater reduction of self-reported negative feelings and insula activation in individuals with higher trait worry. The current study indicates that the neural mechanisms underlying distraction seem to be altered in pathological worrying and may prevent adaptive emotional processing of aversive stimuli leading to the maintenance of fear.',\n",
       "  'Understanding of the different types of fibre in the normal diet is growing. In parallel, there is increasing awareness that these various types of fibre serve differing and complementary physiological functions. Application of this knowledge in enteral formulas is now occurring. These liquid products have traditionally been free of fibre, or supplemented with a single fibre source. The latter approach has not proved to be as effective as might have been anticipated, and impaired bowel function, in the form of constipation and diarrhoea, continues to be cited as the most common complaint associated with enteral feeding. Inclusion of a mixture of fibres represents a more physiological approach than supplementing products with a single fibre source. Studies in healthy volunteers and in the clinical setting indicate that such products are well tolerated and help to maintain normal bowel function. Animal studies demonstrate that fibre is vital in maintaining gut structure and integrity. These results suggest that fibre should perhaps be considered as an essential ingredient in the majority of enteral formulas. Future developments may allow further refinement of fibre mixes for specific diseases and conditions.',\n",
       "  'Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel accessory (&bgr;) subunits associate with pore-forming Kv &agr; subunits and modify the properties and/or cell surface expression of Kv channels in heterologous expression systems. There is very little presently known, however, about the functional role(s) of Kv &bgr; subunits in the generation of native cardiac Kv channels. Exploiting mice with a targeted disruption of the Kv&bgr;1 gene (Kv&bgr;1−/−), the studies here were undertaken to explore directly the role of Kv&bgr;1 in the generation of ventricular Kv currents. Action potential waveforms and peak Kv current densities are indistinguishable in myocytes isolated from the left ventricular apex (LVA) of Kv&bgr;1−/− and wild-type (WT) animals. Analysis of Kv current waveforms, however, revealed that mean±SEM Ito,f density is significantly (P≤0.01) lower in Kv&bgr;1−/− (21.0±0.9 pA/pF; n=68), than in WT (25.3±1.4 pA/pF; n=42), LVA myocytes, and that mean±SEM IK,slow density is significantly (P≤0.01) higher in Kv&bgr;1−/− (19.1±0.9 pA/pF; n=68), compared with WT (15.9±0.7 pA/pF; n=42), LVA cells. Pharmacological studies demonstrated that the TEA-sensitive component of IK,slow, IK,slow2, is selectively increased in Kv&bgr;1−/− LVA myocytes. In parallel with the alterations in Ito,f and IK,slow2 densities, Kv4.3 expression is decreased and Kv2.1 expression is increased in Kv&bgr;1−/− ventricles. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Kv&bgr;1 differentially regulates the functional cell surface expression of myocardial Ito,f and IK,slow2 channels.',\n",
       "  'In this study, we constructed tissue-engineered nerves with acellular nerve allografts in Sprague-Dawley rats, which were prepared using chemical detergents-enzymatic digestion and mechanical methods, in combination with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells of Wistar rats cultured in vitro, to repair 15 mm sciatic bone defects in Wistar rats. At postoperative 12 weeks, electrophysiological detection results showed that the conduction velocity of regenerated nerve after repair with tissue-engineered nerves was similar to that after autologous nerve grafting, and was higher than that after repair with acellular nerve allografts. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that motor endplates with acetylcholinesterase-positive nerve fibers were orderly arranged in the middle and superior parts of the gastrocnemius muscle; regenerated nerve tracts and sprouted branches were connected with motor endplates, as shown by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry combined with silver staining. The wet weight ratio of the tibialis anterior muscle at the affected contralateral hind limb was similar to the sciatic nerve after repair with autologous nerve grafts, and higher than that after repair with acellular nerve allografts. The hind limb motor function at the affected side was significantly improved, indicating that acellular nerve allografts combined with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell bridging could promote functional recovery of rats with sciatic nerve defects.',\n",
       "  'Constitutive JAK/STAT3 signaling contributes to disease progression in many lymphoproliferative disorders. Recent genetic analyses have revealed gain-of-function STAT3 mutations in lymphoid cancers leading to hyperactivation of STAT3, which may represent a potential therapeutic target. Using a functional reporter assay, we screened 306 compounds with selective activity against various target molecules to identify drugs capable of inhibiting the cellular activity of STAT3. Top hits were further validated with additional models including STAT3-mutated natural killer (NK)-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia cells to assess their ability to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 dependent cell viability. We identified JAK, mTOR, Hsp90 and CDK inhibitors as potent inhibitors of both WT and mutant STAT3 activity. The Hsp90 inhibitor luminespib was highly effective at reducing the viability of mutant STAT3 NK cell lines and LGL leukemia patient samples. Luminespib decreased the phosphorylation of mutant STAT3 at Y705, whereas JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib had reduced efficacy on mutant STAT3 phosphorylation. Additionally, combinations involving Hsp90, JAK and mTOR inhibitors were more effective at reducing cell viability than single agents. Our findings show alternative approaches to inhibit STAT3 activity and suggest Hsp90 as a therapeutic target in lymphoproliferative disorders with constitutively active STAT3.',\n",
       "  'Summary: The current work characterizes young men’s memory for young women’s heterosocially relevant affective cues (e.g. sexual interest and rejection) and examines characteristics of both the woman being perceived and the male perceiver as predictors of memory. Undergraduate men (n ¼232) completed similarity-ratings and recognition-memory tasks with photos of undergraduate women who varied in attractiveness, provocativeness of clothing and expression of sexual interest. Participants also completed a control memory task and a measure relevant to the risk of exhibiting sexually aggressive behaviour, as well as indicating how many serious relationships they had experienced. Multilevel regression techniques revealed that (a) men’s memory for women’s sexual interest improved when women were sexually interested at encoding, attractive and dressed provocatively; (b) men who reported more frequent serious relationships showed better memory for women’s sexual interest and (c) men at risk of exhibiting sexually aggressive behaviour showed worse memory for women’s sexual interest. Copyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Men’s memory for women’s heterosocially relevant affect (e.g. sexual interest and rejection) is a surprisingly understudied area of inquiry, given the hypothesized centrality of affective processing to social interactions, intimate relationships and sexual aggression among acquaintances (e.g. Abbey, McAuslan, & Ross, 1998; Casey, Garrett, Brackett, & Rivers, 2007; Mayer, Roberts, & Barsade, 2008; McFall, 1990). Nonverbal affective cues, particularly sexual-interest and rejection cues, frequently are used to communicate to a current or potential partner the likelihood that initial or continued sexual overtures will be received positively (e.g. Abbey, 1982; Fichten, Tagalakis, Judd, Wright, & Amsel, 1992; Muehlenhard, Koralewski, Andrews, & Burdick, 1986). Heterosocial competence requires not only accurate perception of these affective cues, however, but also recognition of changes in the cues, such as from positive to negative. Memory provides critical support for successful change detection, via adequate storage and retrieval of affective information. Successful initiation and maintenance of serious romantic relationships, for example, necessitate detection and retention of the fluctuations in a partner’s emotions. Moreover, decreased attention and sensitivity to young women’s affective cues have been linked to an increased risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behaviour towards acquaintances among college-aged males (see review by Farris, Treat, Viken, & McFall, 2008). Above and beyond impoverished encoding of women’s affect, however, insufficient storage or retrieval of women’s affective cues may decrease the likelihood that high-risk men recognize and respond appropriately to women’s changing affect. In sum, careful characterization of the correlates of memory for young women’s sexual interest may advance our understanding of the role of affective processing in both normative and problematic heterosocial interactions. The present work uses multilevel modelling techniques to distinguish two classes of influences on men’s memory:',\n",
       "  'Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the synaptic and metabolic actions of glutamate. These iGluRs are classified within the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type, kainate-type, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type functional receptor families. The iGluR assemblies are regulated by transcription, alternative splicing, and cytoplasmic post-translational modifications. The iGluR subunit proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum, inserted into the synaptic membranes, and anchored at their action site by different scaffolding and interacting proteins. The functional properties of iGluRs depend on their subunit composition, the amino acid sequence of the protein domains, and the scaffolding proteins in the synaptic membranes. The iGluRs are removed from the membranes by enzymatic action and endocytosis. Hippocampal iGluRs are rearranged through the upregulation and downregulation of the subunits following deafferentation and epileptic seizures. The rearrangement of iGluRs and the alteration of their subunit composition transform neurons into “pathological” cells, determining the further plasticity or pathology of the hippocampal formation. In the present review, we summarize the expression of AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptor subunits following deafferentation, repeated mild seizures, and status epilepticus. We compare our results to literature descriptions, and draw conclusions as to the reactive plasticity of iGluRs in the hippocampus.',\n",
       "  'Aim The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a global public health concern that has resulted in the rapid growth in the number of infected patients with significant mortality rates. Hence, we conducted a retrospective study in Gadarif Hospital to evaluate the presenting manifestations, mortality rate, and the risk factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients. Methods A retrospective study was conducted at Gadarif Hospital in Eastern Sudan. Medical files of the patients admitted during the period between April and July 2020 were reviewed. All the files of the adult patients (aged 18 or above), of both sexes, who had a confirmed COVID-19-positive status via laboratory testing using PCR and who were admitted during this period were reviewed. The data extracted included patients’ demographics and initial clinical presentation, symptoms, signs, and the laboratory and radiographic findings. The data were analyzed using SPSS v22. Results Eighty-eight patients were admitted with COVID-19. The median (interquartile) age was 62 (55.00–70.00) years old, and 72 (81.8%) of them were males. Most patients (75%) experienced a one-week duration of symptoms. A fever (87.5%), cough (80.68%), and shortness of breath (77.27%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Following a clinical assessment, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure were found to be normal in most patients, at 92.05% and 89.77%, respectively. An oxygen saturation of less than 90% was seen in 71.59% of patients. The general mortality rate was 37.5% and most deaths occurred during the first 24 h of admission (21/33 [63.64%]). There was no significant difference in the death rate between females and males (5/16 [31.3%] vs 28/72 [38.9%], P = 0.776). There was no significant difference in the body mass index, tobacco use, or education level between the patients who died and those who survived. A logistic regression showed that being older (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI = [1.01, 1.10]) and having a lower PO2 level (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = [1.04, 1.16]) were associated with mortality. Conclusion The general mortality rate was 37.5%, and the risk factors that could predict increased mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 positive cases included old age and a lower PO2 level.',\n",
       "  'Background The Brain Injury Guidelines provide an algorithm fortreating patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and intracranial hemorrhage(ICH) that does not mandate hospital admission, repeat head CT, orneurosurgical consult for all patients. The purposes of this study are toreview the guidelines’ safety, to assess resource utilization, and to proposeguideline modifications that improve patient safety and widespreadreproducibility. Methods A multi-institutional review of TBI patients was conducted. Patients with ICH on CT were classified as BIG 1, 2, or 3 based on the guidelines. BIG 3 patients were excluded. Variables collected included demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit LOS, number of head CTs, type of injury, progression of injury, and neurosurgical interventions performed. Results 269 patients met inclusion criteria. 98 were classifiedas BIG 1 and 171 as BIG 2. The median length of stay (LOS) was 2 (2,4)days and the ICU LOS was 1 (0,2) days. Most patients had a neurosurgeryconsultation (95.9%) and all patients included had a repeat head CT. 370repeat head CT scans were performed, representing 1.38 repeat scans perpatient. 11.2% of BIG 1 and 11.1% of BIG 2 patients demonstratedworsening on repeat head CT. Patients who progressed exhibited a higherISS (14 vs. 10, p=0.040), and had a longer length of stay (4 vs. 2 days;p=0.015). After adjusting for other variables, the presence of epiduralhematoma (EDH) and intraparenchymal hematoma were independent predictors ofprogression. Two BIG 2 patients with EDH had clinical deteriorationrequiring intervention. Discussion The Brain Injury Guidelines may improve resourceallocation if utilized, but alterations are required to ensure patientsafety. The modified Brain Injury Guidelines refine the originalguidelines to enhance reproducibility and patient safety while continuing toprovide improved resource utilization in TBI management.',\n",

       "  'Abstract Background Danon disease is an X-linked dominant disorder with defects in the lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) gene and is characterized histologically by intracellular autophagic vacuoles in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping potentially allows to differentiate intracellular and extracellular cardiac abnormalities with a combination of native T1 value and extracellular volume (ECV) fraction. Case summary We assessed CMR T1 mapping in two Danon disease patients (a 22-year-old man and his 48-year-old mother), who had a LAMP2 c.864G>A p. Val288Val mutation, and two blood relatives without Danon disease (his 47-year-old maternal aunt and 49-year-old father). The male patient underwent a left ventricular (LV) assist device implantation at 15\\u2009months after the image acquisition because he was inotrope dependent (INTERMACS profile 3) and had no noticeable psychological or musculoskeletal symptoms. His mother was in New York Heart Association Class II with mildly reduced LV ejection fraction (46%). The Danon group showed late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the anterior and posterolateral LV walls. In the interventricular wall, where evident LGE was not noted, the Danon group had high native T1 value, compared with the T1 value in the non-Danon group, and normal ECV fraction. Cardiac biopsy from the interventricular wall showed intracytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles, which are characteristics of Danon disease. Discussion This characteristic pattern of high native T1 and normal ECV fraction in the areas without LGE, which may reflect the existence of intracytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles, may support the differential diagnosis of Danon disease from other cardiomyopathies.',\n",

       "  'Background: There are many approaches to the medial orbital wall. However, most of them have problems with limitation of exposure, scarring, and postoperative inflammatory symptoms related to the eye. The authors used an upper eyelid crease approach to overcome these problems and investigate the usefulness of this approach. Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, the authors used this approach in 22 patients with medial orbital wall fractures. Incisions were performed on the medial one-third of the crease and a 2- to 3-mm superomedial extension along a relaxed skin tension line. Results: Postoperative computed tomographic scans demonstrated complete reduction and accurate reconstitution of the bony defect in all cases. The initial two cases had revision to correct the implant position. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 28 months, with an average of 12 months. Complications related to the operation were not observed. Diplopia and limitation of eye movement resolved in most cases. Two patients had persistent diplopia for more than 6 months that decreased with time. Enophthalmos of more than 2 mm was not observed in any orbit. The operative scar was inconspicuous. Conclusions: This approach provides several advantages, including ease of exposure, and is more familiar to the plastic surgeon than the transconjunctival approach. There is little need to retract the globe laterally, thus minimizing postoperative inflammatory symptoms related to the eye. Therefore, the authors suggest that this method should be considered as a natural and useful surgical approach to medial orbital blowout fractures.

       "  'Objective The influence of gravity on the velopharyngeal structures in children is unknown. The purpose of this study is to compare the velopharyngeal mechanism in the upright and supine positions while at rest and during sustained speech production in children between 4 and 8 years old. Methods A 0.6 Tesla open-type, multipositional magnetic resonance imaging scanner was used to image subjects in the upright and supine positions. The scanning protocol included a T2 fluid attenuation inversion recovery and an oblique coronal turbo spin echo scan with short scanning durations (7.9 seconds) to enable visualization of the velopharyngeal anatomy during rest and production of sustained /i/ and /s/. Results The magnetic resonance imaging protocol used for this study enabled successful visualization of the velopharyngeal anatomy in the sagittal and oblique coronal planes at rest and during sustained phonation of /i/ and /s/. Positional differences demonstrated a small nonsignificant (P > .05) variation for velar measures (length, thickness, and height), retrovelar space, and levator veli palatini measures (length and angles of origin). Conclusions Gravity had a negligible effect on velar length, velar thickness, velar height, retrovelar space, levator muscle length, and levator angles of origin. Supine imaging data can be translated to an upright activity such as speech. This is the first study to provide normative levator muscle lengths for children between 4 and 8 years old. Upright imaging may be a promising tool for difficult-to-test populations.',\n",
       "  'Sentence repetition tasks are widely used in the diagnosis and assessment of children with language difficulties. This paper seeks to clarify the nature of sentence repetition tasks and their relationship to other language skills. We present the results from a 2-year longitudinal study of 216 children. Children were assessed on measures of sentence repetition, vocabulary knowledge and grammatical skills three times at approximately yearly intervals starting at age 4. Sentence repetition was not a unique longitudinal predictor of the growth of language skills. A unidimensional language latent factor (defined by sentence repetition, vocabulary knowledge and grammatical skills) provided an excellent fit to the data, and language abilities showed a high degree of longitudinal stability. Sentence repetition is best seen as a reflection of an underlying language ability factor rather than as a measure of a separate construct with a specific role in language processing. Sentence repetition appears to be a valuable tool for language assessment because it draws upon a wide range of language processing skills.',\n",

Therelationship between toxocariasis and asthma has always been a subject of discussion. Objectives: This study evaluated the seroepidemiology of Toxocara among asthmatic children. Methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated 150 children aged 3 - 12 years with asthma presentations, who were referred to Dr. Sheikh Hospital of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences from April 2017 to March 2018. Serum samples were tested for the presence of anti- Toxocara antibodies using Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive sera were conﬁrmed by the Western Blotting (WB) method. Results: Out of 150 asthmatic patients, Toxocara immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses were observed in two (1.3%) patients by ELISA and one (0.6%) patient by both ELISA and WB. Moreover, none of the patients was detected as hypereosinophilia. Conclusions: It seems there is no signiﬁcant relationship between Toxocara infection and asthma in Northeastern Iran. These ﬁnd-ings suggest the need for WB immunodiagnosis and ELISA using Toxocara antigens to improve human toxocariasis diagnosis in patients with asthma.',\n",
       "  \"Background YouTube is one of the largest social networking websites, allowing users to upload and view video content that provides entertainment and conveys many messages, including those related to health conditions, such as concussion. However, little is known about the content of videos relating to concussion. Objective To identify and classify the content of concussion-related videos available on YouTube. Study design An observational study using content analysis. Methods YouTube's video database was systematically searched using 10 search terms selected from MeSH and Google Adwords. The 100 videos with the largest view counts were chosen from the identified videos. These videos and their accompanying text were analysed for purpose, source and description of content by a panel of assessors who classified them into data-driven thematic categories. Results 434 videos met the inclusion criteria and the 100 videos with the largest view counts were chosen. The most common categories of the videos were the depiction of a sporting injury (37%) and news reports (25%). News and media organisations were the predominant source (51%) of concussion-related videos on YouTube, with very few being uploaded by professional or academic organisations. The median number of views per video was 26\\u2005191. Conclusions Although a wide range of concussion-related videos were identified, there is a need for healthcare and educational organisations to explore YouTube as a medium for the dissemination of quality-controlled information on sports concussion.\",\n",
       "  'BACKGROUND:There are significant differences in the postoperative morphological and hemodynamic conditions of the carotid arteries between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and endarterectomy (CEA). OBJECTIVE:To compare the postoperative rheological conditions after CAS with those after CEA with patch angioplasty (patch CEA) through the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on patient-specific data. METHODS:The rheological conditions in the carotid arteries were simulated in 2 patients after CAS and in 2 patients after patch CEA by CFD calculations. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the carotid arteries was performed with the images obtained with computed tomography angiography. The streamlines and wall shear stress (WSS) were calculated by a supercomputer. Adequate boundary conditions were determined by comparing the simulation results with ultrasound flow data. RESULTS:CFD was successfully calculated for all patients. The differences between the flow velocities of ultrasound data and those of the simulation results were limited. In the streamline analysis, the maximum flow velocities in the internal carotid artery after patch CEA were around two-thirds of those after CAS. Rotational slow flow was observed in the internal carotid artery bulb after patch CEA. WSS analysis found regional low WSS near the outer wall of the bulb. High WSS was observed at the distal end of the arteriotomy after patch CEA and at the residual stenosis after CAS. CONCLUSION:CFD of postoperative carotid arteries disclosed the differences in streamlines and WSS between CAS and patch CEA. CFD may allow us to obtain adequate rheological conditions conducive to achieving the best clinical results.',\n",
       "  'Background: Exposure to ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can cause adverse health effects, including premature mortality due to cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer. Recent studies quantify global air pollution mortality but not the contribution of different emissions sectors, or they focus on a specific sector. Objectives: We estimated the global mortality burden of anthropogenic ozone and PM2.5, and the impact of five emissions sectors, using a global chemical transport model at a finer horizontal resolution (0.67° × 0.5°) than previous studies. Methods: We performed simulations for 2005 using the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 4 (MOZART-4), zeroing out all anthropogenic emissions and emissions from specific sectors (All Transportation, Land Transportation, Energy, Industry, and Residential and Commercial). We estimated premature mortality using a log-linear concentration–response function for ozone and an integrated exposure–response model for PM2.5. Results: We estimated 2.23 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.33) million deaths/year related to anthropogenic PM2.5, with the highest mortality in East Asia (48%). The Residential and Commercial sector had the greatest impact globally—675 (95% CI: 428, 899) thousand deaths/year—and in most regions. Land Transportation dominated in North America (32% of total anthropogenic PM2.5 mortality), and it had nearly the same impact (24%) as Residential and Commercial (27%) in Europe. Anthropogenic ozone was associated with 493 (95% CI: 122, 989) thousand deaths/year, with the Land Transportation sector having the greatest impact globally (16%). Conclusions: The contributions of emissions sectors to ambient air pollution–related mortality differ among regions, suggesting region-specific air pollution control strategies. Global sector-specific actions targeting Land Transportation (ozone) and Residential and Commercial (PM2.5) sectors would particularly benefit human health.

       "  'Background:The risk of liver enzyme elevation (LEE) after different ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r) has not been fully assessed in real-life settings and in populations with high rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. Methods:Patients introducing a new PI/r between 1998 and 2012 were included, if transaminases and HCV antibody (Ab) were assessed before treatment initiation. Time to grade 3 and 4 LEE were assessed using univariable and multivariable conditional Cox analyses, stratified by HCV serostatus. Results:A total of 6193 HIV-infected patients (3242 HCV-Ab negative and 2951 HCV-Ab positive) were included. Incidence of grade 3 LEE was 1.05, 7.66, and 8.08 per 100 patient-years of follow-up among HCV-Ab negative, HCV-Ab–positive and HCV-RNA–positive patients, respectively. Among HCV-Ab–negative patients, no differences were detected between different PI/r. Use of darunavir/ritonavir was not associated with LEE among HCV-coinfected patients. Atazanavir/ritonavir use was associated with grade 3 LEE but only among HCV-Ab–positive patients (versus LPV/r, hazard ratio: 1.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 1.75). This risk was not confirmed in a subanalysis restricted to HCV-RNA–positive patients (versus LPV/r, hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 0.87 to 1.55). Other independent predictors of grade 3 LEE among HCV-Ab–positive patients were older age, male gender, being treatment naive, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor coadministration, increased aspartate aminotransferase at baseline, overweight, positive HCV-RNA, and advanced estimated liver fibrosis. Conclusions:Occurrence of hepatotoxicity was a rare finding among HCV-Ab–negative patients and was not influenced by the type of PI/r. In particular, the use of darunavir/ritonavir, previously linked with severe cases of hepatotoxicity, was not associated with a greater risk of LEE, irrespective from HCV serostatus.',\n",

       "  'Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection is the most common cause of viral myocarditis. The pathogenesis of viral myocarditis is strongly controlled by host genetic factors. Although certain indispensable components of immunity have been identified, the genes and pathways underlying natural variation between individuals remain unclear. Previously, we isolated the viral myocarditis susceptibility 1 (Vms1) locus on chromosome 3, which influences pathogenesis. We hypothesized that confirmation and further study of Vms1 controlling CVB3-mediated pathology, combined with pathway analysis and consomic mapping approaches, would elucidate both pathological and protective mechanisms accounting for natural variation in response to CVB3 infection. Vms1 was originally mapped to chromosome 3 using a segregating cross between susceptible A/J and resistant B10.A mice. To validate Vms1, C57BL/6J-Chr 3A/NaJ (a chromosome substitution strain that carries a diploid A/J chromosome 3) were used to replicate susceptibility compared with resistant C57BL/6J (B6). A second segregating F2 cross was generated between these, confirming both the localization and effects of Vms1. Microarray analysis of the four strains (A/J, B10.A, C57BL/6J, and C57BL/6J-Chr 3A/NaJ) illuminated a core program of response to CVB3 in all strains that is comprised mainly of IFN-stimulated genes. Microarray analysis also revealed strain-specific differential expression programs and genes that may be prognostic or diagnostic of susceptibility to CVB3 infection. A combination of analyses revealed very strong evidence for the existence and location of Vms1. Differentially expressed pathways were identified by microarray, and candidate gene analysis revealed Fpgt, H28, and Tnni3k as likely candidates for Vms1.',\n",
       "  'ObjectiveAcute abdominal complication in the medical intensive care unit may be underdiagnosed and can add significant risk of death. We hypothesize that delays in surgery because of atypical presentation, such as the absence of peritoneal signs, may contribute to mortality. DesignRetrospective cohort study (1995–2000). SettingMedical intensive care unit in a tertiary care center. PatientsMedical intensive care unit patients with clinical, surgical, or autopsy diagnosis of acute abdominal catastrophe (gangrenous or perforated viscus). InterventionsNone. Measurements and Main ResultsSeventy-seven patients (1.3%) met inclusion criteria. Ischemic bowel was the most common diagnosis, followed by perforated ulcer, bowel obstruction, and cholecystitis. Actual mortality rate was higher than predicted by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III scores at the time of medical intensive care unit admission (63% vs. 31%). Twenty-six patients (34%) did not have surgery, and none of these survived. Fifty-one patients underwent surgery and 28 survived (56%). Delay in surgical evaluation (p < .01) and intervention (p < .03), APACHE III scores (p < .01), renal insufficiency (p < .01), and a diagnosis of ischemic bowel (p < .01) were associated with increased mortality rates. Surgical delay was more likely to occur in patients with altered mental state (p < .01), no peritoneal signs (p < .01), previous opioids (p < .03), antibiotics (p < .02), and mechanical ventilation (p < .02). ConclusionDelays in surgical evaluation and intervention are critical contributors to mortality rate in patients who develop acute abdominal complications in a medical intensive care unit.',\n",

       "  'Caudal luring is the waving of a conspicuous tail tip by a camouflaged snake, which mimics invertebrate larvae to lure prey within striking distance. This behaviour was recorded mainly in juveniles, which feed on ectothermic prey (amphibians, and lizards), but also in some adult snakes of species that continue to feed on ectothermic prey (e.g., Bothrops bilineatus , C. vipera and V. latasti ) or feed on birds that can be attracted by caudal luring ( B. insularis ). Most of the records in literature were performed through provoked encounters, mainly with snakes in captivity, in which prey are offered to the snakes to observe predation behaviour. We report here a number of observations of B. b. smaragdinus using caudal luring for the first time in nature, in a forest in the western Brazilian Amazon. During the limited time search (408 men-hours) and complementary records during the night, 72 observations (meetings and re-encounters) of 32 snakes and 15 during five complementary daytime samplings were performed, totaling 87 records. This study was the one in which most snakes were observed performing caudal luring in their natural habitat, without offering prey (provoked encounters). We conclude from these preliminary data that the snake Bothrops bilineatus smaragdinus often uses this tactic during nocturnal hunting on vegetation in the absence of potential prey regardless of the size of the snake, tail tip color, and height substrate in which it is hunting.',\n",

       "  'The management of chronic myeloid leukemia with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors has evolved chronic myeloid leukemia into a chronic, manageable disease. A patient-centered approach is important for the appropriate management of chronic myeloid leukemia and optimization of long-term treatment outcomes. The pharmacist plays a key role in treatment selection, monitoring drug–drug interactions, identification and management of adverse events, and educating patients on adherence. The combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with unique safety profiles and individual patients with unique medical histories can make managing treatment difficult. This review will provide up-to-date information regarding tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Management strategies for adverse events and considerations for drug–drug interactions will not only vary among patients but also across tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Drug–drug interactions can be mild to severe. In instances where co-administration of concomitant medications cannot be avoided, it is critical to understand how drug levels are impacted and how subsequent dose modifications ensure therapeutic drug levels are maintained. An important component of patient-centered management of chronic myeloid leukemia also includes educating patients on the significance of early and regular monitoring of therapeutic milestones, emphasizing the importance of adhering to treatment in achieving these targets, and appropriately modifying treatment if these clinical goals are not being met. Overall, staying apprised of current research, utilizing the close pharmacist–patient relationship, and having regular interactions with patients, will help achieve successful long-term treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in the age of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors.',\n",
       "  'The WISDOM study (NCT00975195) reported a change in lung function following withdrawal of fluticasone propionate in patients with severe to very severe COPD treated with tiotropium and salmeterol. However, little is known about the validity of home-based spirometry measurements of lung function in COPD. Therefore, as part of this study, following suitable training, patients recorded daily home-based spirometry measurements in addition to undergoing periodic in-clinic spirometric testing throughout the study duration. We subsequently determined the validity of home-based spirometry for detecting changes in lung function by comparing in-clinic and home-based forced expiratory volume in 1 second in patients who underwent stepwise fluticasone propionate withdrawal over 12 weeks versus patients remaining on fluticasone propionate for 52 weeks. Bland–Altman analysis of these data confirmed good agreement between in-clinic and home-based measurements, both across all visits and at the individual visits at study weeks 6, 12, 18, and 52. There was a measurable difference between the forced expiratory volume in 1 second values recorded at home and in the clinic (mean difference of −0.05 L), which may be due to suboptimal patient effort in performing unsupervised recordings. However, this difference remained consistent over time. Overall, these data demonstrate that home-based and in-clinic spirometric measurements were equally valid and reliable for assessing lung function in patients with COPD, and suggest that home-based spirometry may be a useful tool to facilitate analysis of changes in lung function on a day-to-day basis.',\n",
       "  'Kahn and Hobson (1993) proposed that dreams are a product of self-organization of brain during sleep. As a complex system far from equilibrium state, the dreaming brain may form a new pattern by the interaction between components within this system. At REM sleep stage, signals from neuronal clusters self-organize and form image fragments, then the image fragments interact and produce images, and finally thesematerials are associated into a relatively continuous narrative (i.e., dreams). This process above happens under a weak control of brain, and the conditions of this state mainly include: (a) the inhibition of external stimuli or feedback; (b) the changes of neuromodulatory systems (e.g., the governance of aminergic neurochemicals and the weakness of cholinergic neurochemicals); (c) the bombardment of PGO wave to the visual cortex; and (d) the changes of neural activity in brain (e.g., the activation of limbic system and the reduction of prefrontal regions). In this situation, the brain could focus on the internal world and integrate various psychological and physiological changes into dream content (Kahn et al., 2000, 2002). However, self-organization mechanism could not determine which memories will be activated and incorporated into dream content (Kahn, 2013), although it provides an approach how an ordered structure, behavior or pattern spontaneously emerges from the interaction between components or subsystems without an external guidance (see Isaeva, 2012; Sasai, 2013). It merely combines materials which present during sleep and then makes up a “story.” Thus, the content of dreams is, to a large degree, determined by the active materials in sleep. In this article, we attempt to make a supplement to this theory on the basis of the two-stage model of memory consolidation.',\n",
       "  \"Large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (BK) channels are comprised of four pore-forming α-subunits (Slo1), whose mRNA is alternatively spliced in a cell-specific manner. Here we report the first case of a correctly spliced mutually exclusive exon in a mammalian (human and mouse) BK channel; an exon coding for the region from S6 to the RCK1 domain is exchanged for an alternative exon of the same length. The slo1 transcript with this novel exon is present in native brain tissues and inclusion of the alternative exon profoundly alters the channel's gating characteristics: faster activation at low Ca2+ concentrations and greater open probability at resting membrane potential at high Ca2+ concentrations. The novel gating features conferred by the alternative exon are dominant over those of the commonly described Slo1 variant when coexpressed. The evolutionarily-preserved splicing of the Slo1 S6-RCK1 linker segment possess great potential to fine-tune neuronal excitability.\",\n",

       "  'Background Globally, the status of women’s health falls short of its potential. In addition to the deleterious ethical and human rights implications of this deficit, the negative economic impact may also be consequential, but these mechanisms are poorly understood. Building on the literature that highlights health as a driver of economic growth and poverty alleviation, we aim to systematically investigate the broader economic benefits of investing in women’s health. Methods Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically reviewed health, gender, and economic literature to identify studies that investigate the impact of women’s health on micro- and macroeconomic outcomes. We developed an extensive search algorithm and conducted searches using 10 unique databases spanning the timeframe 01/01/1970 to 01/04/2013. Articles were included if they reported on economic impacts stemming from changes in women’s health (table of outcome measures included in full review, Table 1). In total, the two lead investigators independently screened 20,832 abstracts and extracted 438 records for full text review. The final review reflects the inclusion of 124 articles. Results The existing literature indicates that healthier women and their children contribute to more productive and better-educated societies. This study documents an extensive literature confirming that women’s health is tied to long-term productivity: the development and economic performance of nations depends, in part, upon how each country protects and promotes the health of women. Providing opportunities for deliberate family planning; healthy mothers before, during, and after childbirth, and the health and productivity of subsequent generations can catalyze a cycle of positive societal development. Conclusions This review highlights the untapped potential of initiatives that aim to address women’s health. Societies that prioritize women’s health will likely have better population health overall, and will remain more productive for generations to come.',\n",
       "  'Alteration of the mouse genome through homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells is the most accurate and versatile way to dissect gene function in a vertebrate model. Most often, a selectable marker is used to create a knockout allele by replacing an essential part of the gene. However, knockout strategies are limited because the mutation is present constitutively. Conditional approaches based on the Cre‐loxP site‐specific recombination (SSR) system address this limitation; however, it requires that all parts of the targeted gene remain in ES cells. Here we report success with a “knockout‐first” strategy that ablates gene function by insertion of RNA processing signals without deletion of any of the target gene. Incorporation of site‐specific recombination target sites creates a multipurpose allele for both knockout and conditional applications. genesis 38:151–158, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.',\n",

       "  'ABSTRACT Pathogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in host innate immune responses through regulating the quality and quantity of inflammatory mediators. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this effect have yet to be clarified. In this study, we examined the mechanism of action of ROS stimulated by Porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival epithelial cells. P. gingivalis induced the rapid production of ROS, which lead to the phosphorylation of JAK2 and increased levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1β. Neutralization of ROS by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) abrogated the phosphorylation of JAK2 and suppressed the production of IL-6 and IL-1β. ROS-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2 induced the phosphoactivation of c-Jun amino-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and the downstream transcriptional regulator c-Jun. Inhibition of JAK2, either pharmacologically or by small interfering RNA (siRNA), reduced both the phosphorylation of these molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to P. gingivalis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition or siRNA-mediated gene silencing of JNK or c-Jun mimicked the effect of JAK2 inhibition to suppress P. gingivalis-induced IL-6 and IL-1β levels. The results show that ROS-mediated activation of JAK2 is required for P. gingivalis-induced inflammatory cytokine production and that the JNK/c-Jun signaling axis is involved in the ROS-dependent regulation of IL-1β and IL-6 production.',\n",

       "  'Heterotopic ossification (HO) frequently occurs after brain injury. Recently, we found that leptin levels were decreased in the serum of patients with HO. Data suggest two mechanisms mediating leptin effects: a central suppressive mechanism acting via the β2-adrenergic system and a direct stimulatory action starting when leptin binds to its receptors in osteoblastic cells. In this study, we analyzed leptin and β2-adrenergic receptors mRNA expression in osteocytes originated from normal or heterotopic bone biopsies to investigate whether direct or indirect pathway signaling might be implicated in this pathological bone formation. We report for the first time the mRNA expression of the leptin receptor isoforms in osteocytes isolated from all biopsies. Moreover, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allowed us to measure a significant decrease in the level of β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA in cells isolated from heterotopic bone biopsies. These results could suggest an association between hypothalamic leptin signaling and brain injury-related HO.',\n",
       "  'The objective of the this study was to investigate the binding capacity and removal ability of lactic acid bacterial strains obtained from Korean soybean paste for mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HCAs) formed during cooking of protein-rich food at high temperature. Among 19 strains identified by carbohydrate fermentation and 16S rRNA sequencing, the live cell or cell-free culture supernatant of Lactobacillus acidophilus D11, Enterococcus faecium D12, Pediococcus acidilactici D19, L. acidophilus D38, Lactobacillus sakei D44, Enterococcus faecalis D66, and Lactobacillus plantarum D70 inhibited the mutagenesis caused by either 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b] indole (Trp-P-1) or 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b] indole (Trp-P-2) in Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100. The bacterial cells of the isolated strains showed greater binding activity than the pure cell wall, exopolysaccharide, and pepetidoglycan. The carbohydrate moieties of the cell wall or protein molecules on the cell surface have a significant role in binding Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2, since protease, heating, sodium metaperiodate, or acidic pH treatments significantly (P<0.05) reduced the binding efficacy of the tested bacteria. Addition of metal ions or sodium dodecyl sulfate decreased the binding ability of E. faecium D12, L. acidophilus D38, and E. faecalis D66. Therefore, the binding mechanisms of these strains may consist of ion-exchange and hydrophobic bonds. Especially, the high mutagen binding by L. acidophilus D38 and L. plantarum D70 may reduce the accumulation or absorption of Trp-P-1 and Trp-P-2 in the small intestine via increased excretion of a mutagen-bacteria complex.',\n",
       "  'Intronic expansion of a hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene is the major cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. However, the cellular function of the C9ORF72 protein remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that C9ORF72 regulates endosomal trafficking. C9ORF72 colocalized with Rab proteins implicated in autophagy and endocytic transport: Rab1, Rab5, Rab7 and Rab11 in neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons and human spinal cord motor neurons, consistent with previous predictions that C9ORF72 bears Rab guanine exchange factor activity. Consistent with this notion, C9ORF72 was present in the extracellular space and as cytoplasmic vesicles. Depletion of C9ORF72 using siRNA inhibited transport of Shiga toxin from the plasma membrane to Golgi apparatus, internalization of TrkB receptor and altered the ratio of autophagosome marker light chain 3 (LC3) II:LC3I, indicating that C9ORF72 regulates endocytosis and autophagy. C9ORF72 also colocalized with ubiquilin-2 and LC3-positive vesicles, and co-migrated with lysosome-stained vesicles in neuronal cell lines, providing further evidence that C9ORF72 regulates autophagy. Investigation of proteins interacting with C9ORF72 using mass spectrometry identified other proteins implicated in ALS; ubiquilin-2 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1, and actin. Treatment of cells overexpressing C9ORF72 with proteasome inhibitors induced the formation of stress granules positive for hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2/B1. Immunohistochemistry of C9ORF72 ALS patient motor neurons revealed increased colocalization between C9ORF72 and Rab7 and Rab11 compared with controls, suggesting possible dysregulation of trafficking in patients bearing the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Hence, this study identifies a role for C9ORF72 in Rab-mediated cellular trafficking.',\n",

The three guanosine analogs were viral thymidine kinase-dependent inhibitors of virus multiplication. In cell cultures, (S)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine was the least active of these three drugs against a variety of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) strains. This was also the case for a certain HSV-1 or HSV-2 strain in different cell lines. In cell cultures, (R)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine and 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)guanine had similar antiherpes activities. However, in vivo in cutaneous HSV-1 infections in guinea pigs treated topically and in systemic HSV-2 infections in mice treated orally or intraperitoneally, only (R)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine had a therapeutic effect. The extremely short half-life in plasma and the high clearance of 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)guanine as compared with those of (R)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine probably made 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)guanine inefficacious when given intraperitoneally or orally to mice infected with herpesvirus. On the other hand, no kinetic differences between (R)-9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)guanine and 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)guanine were observed in penetration through guinea pig skin ex vivo, and no preferential metabolism of 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)guanine in skin was noted. We deduced that high thymidine levels in guinea pig skin preferentially antagonize the antiviral effect of 9-(4-hydroxybutyl) guanine in cutaneous HSV-1 infections.',\n",

Compared with mothers who were never depressed, those who were sometimes depressed reported less involvement in home- and school-based activities as well as fewer interactions with their child's teacher. Never depressed parents were more likely to be satisfied with their child's teacher compared with either group of depressed mothers. Higher levels of parent involvement and parent–teacher interaction predicted optimal satisfaction with Head Start services. Practice or Policy: Implications of results for practice are considered in terms of teacher training to recognize unique needs involved in working to establish a home–school connection with mothers experiencing depression. Strategies for building community partnerships to assist with mental health needs are discussed.\",\n",

       "  'Background: Large injection site reactions commonly follow booster doses of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines at 4–6 years of age. A vaccine with lower diphtheria and pertussis dosage (Tdap) might be better tolerated for this dose. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded comparison of local reactions to DTaP.inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) or Tdap booster vaccinations, in 4- to 5.5-year-old children. Reactions were assessed daily by parents and after 48 hours by study nurses. Serologic responses were measured before and 4 weeks after vaccination and examined in relation to large local reactions (≥50 mm redness and/or swelling). Results: 288 children were vaccinated, 145 with DTaP.IPV and 143 with Tdap, and after 48 hours examiners noted local redness ≥ 50mm in 17.2 and 6.3%, respectively (P = 0.004). DTaP.IPV vaccinees initially experienced local pain (in 54%) which limited arm motion (in 37%), but symptoms largely resolved by 48 hours. Tdap vaccinees had fewer symptoms (pain in 20%, limited arm motion in 14%). Children with large reactions to DTaP.IPV more often than nonreactors had elevated preimmunization antibody concentrations to 1 or more of diphtheria, pertussis toxin or pertactin and elevated postimmunization antibody concentrations to all antigens except fimbriae. Booster responses to Tdap were reduced with the smaller antigen doses but were generally satisfactory. Conclusions: This preschool DTaP.IPV booster vaccination caused large local reactions in 1 in 5 children, with transient discomfort. With Tdap vaccine, such reactions were significantly fewer but not eliminated. A Tdap.IPV vaccine warrants study for routine use at 4–6 years of age.',\n",

Knowledge of the biological and ecological intricacies of D. geminata is limited, in part due to the absence of a suitable culture medium for the maintenance of the diatom. This paper describes the development of a chemically defined synthetic medium for the short-term culture of D. geminata cells.

This development provides the potential to explore unexplained aspects of D. geminata biology and physiology through robust culture-based laboratory studies.',\n",
       "  \"New medications and new formulations have provided an increase in the cure rates for onychomycosis. Many cases of infection, however, are still not cured. It is not always obvious which factors are most relevant to reduction of cure, and factors may vary with each patient. For these reasons, a multitherapy approach to onychomycosis may be needed to individualize treatment to each patient's specific condition. Different presentations and severity levels of onychomycosis may respond differently to treatment modalities and require varying amounts of intervention. Nail débridement may be used to lessen the burden of infection in cases in which drug penetration may not occur adequately otherwise, such as dermatophytoma, onycholysis, or lateral infection. Ciclopirox nail lacquer has been approved for use in conjunction with regular débridement and represents the first approved multitherapy approach. Topical antifungals may be combined with oral antifungals to provide dual fronts of drug penetration. Similarly, two oral medications may be combined to provide a wider spectrum of antifungal activity and differential mode of action against the organisms, which may increase fungistatic or fungicidal action. There is a nonclinical component of therapy, represented by patient education on onychomycosis infection and treatment, which should be used to ensure that patient expectations are realistic and to encourage patient compliance with the chosen regimens.\",\n",

       "  'Two neonates with intestinal obstruction and two children (aged 1 and 4 years) with severe constipation since birth are reported in whom stenosis of the distal rectum was found. In association with the rectal anomaly, three of them had a presacral tumour (teratoma in two, hamartoma in one) and all had a deformed sacrum. An embryological hypothesis to explain this association has been postulated by Currarino, after whom this triad has been named. Two patients were related (father and daughter). The role of hereditary factors in the occurrence of the syndrome has been reported before. Operative treatment of the rectal stenosis was necessary in all patients. Preoperative diverting colostomy was performed in three cases, followed by a posterior sagittal approach to excise the rectal stenosis and the presacral mass. In one case, persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage required re‐exploration for closure of a tear in a congenially abnormal dural sac. The fourth patient had undergone a low anterior resection in the past via the abdominal route and needed rectal dilatation afterwards for some time. The final result in all patients appears satisfactory, although follow‐up is short. Most cases of this triad have been reported in children but a number of patients have been diagnosed only as adults. Recognition of this triad should imply a careful search for neural crest malformations. Operative treatment to correct all soft tissue anomalies leads to good results.',\n",

       "  'It had been reported that the domestication of dogs began in the late Paleolithic and Mesolithic period. Since, there is a lack of information on anatomical measurements of the skulls of dogs and its clinical value during regional anesthesia; the present work was taken. The investigation was carried out on nineteen mandibles and upper jaws from adult dogs aged between 4-8-year-old without any apparent skeletal disorders. Then, a total of seventeen skull measurements and indices were recorded. The skull length, cranial length, nasal length and cranial width were 17.6 cm, 11.2 cm, 6.38 cm and 7.5 cm respectively. Also, the cranial index was 66.37. In addition, the distances from the root of premolar tooth to infra-orbital canal and from the latter to the root of the canine tooth were 1.07 cm and 3.4 cm, respectively. The length and height of the mandibles were 12.7 cm and 6.5 cm, respectively. Furthermore, the distances from the lateral alveolar root to mental foramen and from the mental foramen to caudal mandibular border were 2.3 cm and 10.3 cm, respectively. In the current work, the distances from mandibular foramen to the base of mandible as well as from caudal border of mandible to below of the mandibular foramen were 1.1 cm and 1.3 cm, respectively. Also, the distances from the base of mandible to condyloid fossa and from the latter to the maximum height of mandible were 4.5 cm and 2.1 cm, respectively. Finally, the distance from caudal border of mandible to mandibular foramen and from the latter to mandibular angle were 0.97 cm and 0.93 cm, respectively. These data as important landmarks are discussed with regard to their application to clinical maneuvers around the head of the adult dogs such as regional anesthesia during treating head injury and dental extraction.',\n",
       "  'We examined the distribution of fibronectin and collagen types I and III in human fetuses under a confocal laser scanning microscope using immunohistochemical staining (at 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 weeks’ gestation). The collagen types I and III form the collagenous matrix components in the connective tissue of the parotid and submandibular glands. These extracellular matrix components were detected at various stages around the terminal portion and in the capsule-like connective tissue of the parotid and submandibular glands. However, the extracellular matrix components in the connective tissue around the terminal portion had a stronger reaction than those in the capsule-like connective tissue found on the fringe of the terminal portion. The collagen type I of the parotid gland at 16 weeks’ gestation had a weaker reaction than that of the submandibular gland. When results of the reaction at other stages and other extracellular matrix components of the two salivary glands were compared, collagen type I appeared as early as at 16 weeks’ gestation in either gland. Since collagen type I serves as the core connective tissue, these observations suggest that the formation of connective tissue around the parotid gland occurs before or after 16 weeks’ gestation lagging behind that of the submandibular gland.',\n",
       "  'Quiescent adult skeletal muscle stem cells (satellite cells) are the main players of myogenesis assuring the possibility of growth and regeneration of the muscle tissue throughout adult life. The environmental stimuli that activate satellite cells induce their proliferation, leading on one hand to self-renewal and maintenance of the muscle stem cell reservoir, and on the other hand to the production of progenitor cells that further proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to form new muscle fibers. Hence, satellite cells constitute a perfect system to study the transitions involved in stem cell differentiation. The multistep process of myogenesis is orchestrated by specific regulatory proteins, such as Pax3/Pax7 or members of the MyoD family of transcription factors. However, findings published over the past few years indicate that epigenetic mechanisms, such as covalent modification of histones, DNA methylation, or regulation of gene expression by microRNAs, also critically repress, maintain, or induce the muscle-specific transcriptional program during myogenesis. These studies have increased our understanding of how the information encoding the muscle lineage is molecularly controlled.',\n",

       "  'Dear Editor, Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) occasionally poses a therapeutic challenge. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a inhibitors such as infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) have become a vital alternative to conventional therapies in GPP treatment. However, loss of efficacy of TNF-a inhibitors occasionally occurs, the formation of antidrug antibodies being one of the possible causes. The clinical efficacy of the concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) with TNF-a inhibitors as a means of reducing the immunogenicity of biologics is becoming more widespread. We report two cases of recalcitrant GPP successfully controlled by an ADA and MTX combination after the failure of IFX monotherapy probably due to anti-infliximab antibody (ATI) formation. A 43-year-old man (case 1) with GPP was referred to our hospital in 2008. His past medical history indicated participation in a clinical trial of IFX at the age of 42 years. Cyclosporin (CSA), MTX and bath psoralen plus ultraviolet A therapy were tested without the desired outcome. Occasional pustule formations were recognized, and IFX was initiated. He had a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 18.2 immediately before IFX therapy. After a slight improvement, a remarkable deterioration of PASI to 30.6 was noted at the third IFX infusion (Fig. 1a). Loss of efficacy was considered and IFX was replaced with ADA. His PASI was 30.0 immediately before ADA therapy. Deterioration of the symptoms was controlled by increasing the ADA dose to 80 mg at week 8 until further deterioration was experienced at week 71 when MTX 5 mg weekly was added. No further flaring of the symptoms was observed up to week 97 of ADA therapy. Serum concentrations of IFX and ADA and the absorbance value of both ATI and adalimumab antibodies (AAA) were measured. As in Figure 1(a), ATI seemed to appear during IFX therapy, and the serum IFX concentrations could not be detected throughout IFX therapy. AAA stayed below the cut-off level throughout the ADA therapy. A 30-year-old woman (case 2) with GPP was referred to our hospital in 2006. CSA and MTX failed to elicit desirable therapeutic responses and IFX treatment was initiated. The patient’s PASI was 23.1 immediately before IFX therapy. During the first 20 weeks, a remarkable decline in the PASI was observed (Fig 1b). As the symptoms gradually intensified, loss of efficacy (a)',\n",
       "  'Background Use of the anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap has gained popularity in head and neck reconstruction. However, donor sites that cannot achieve primary closure are reported to have poorer functional and aesthetic outcomes. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to facilitate primary closure of the donor site. Methods Since May 2013, when an attempt at donor site direct closure failed, we have used a VY advancement flap or a propeller flap for primary closure of the donor site, using the remnant lateral thigh perforator or nearby medial thigh perforator. Otherwise, a skin graft was used. A total of 91 patients were enrolled in this algorithmic approach. We retrospectively reviewed patients with head and neck cancer who underwent cancer ablation and immediate ALT flap reconstruction since August 2010. The patients were then categorized into a “before” group and an “after” group according to the application time of the algorithm. Their demographics, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Results A total of 321 patients (309 men, 12 women) were enrolled, with 230 patients in the before group and 91 patients in the after group, with a mean age of 52.9 years. The mean size of the flap was 130 cm2, with a mean width of 8.1 cm. No statistical difference existed between the groups. The donor site was directly closed in 82 patients (35.7%) in the before group. Using the perforator-based flap in 21 patients (23.1%), the donor site was closed primarily in 72 patients (79.1%) in the after group, contributing to a significantly higher donor site closure rate (P < 0.001). The average operative time was 348.7 minutes. The overall flap survival rate was 97.2%, donor-site complication rate was 6.9%, and hospitalization length was 23.5 days. None showed statistical differences between the groups. Conclusions The proposed algorithm may considerably increase the primary closure rate of the ALT flap donor site.',\n",

A considerable number of binding peptides were distinguished for each of the allelic products tested. In addition, three interesting points emerged. The first was the identification of several binding peptides which did not contain the known anchor motifs. The second was the evidence that several peptides showed a promiscuous binding profile, being able to bind to different HLA class I molecules that were either allelic or non allelic. The third was that in several cases two consecutive peptides could bind to the same HLA molecule.',\n",

       "  'Purpose: Recent studies have suggested that osteopontin is induced by hypoxia in head and neck cancer cell lines and its plasma level may serve as a surrogate marker for tumor hypoxia and treatment outcome in head and neck cancer. We investigated the response of osteopontin to in vitro hypoxia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines, and determined plasma osteopontin levels in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, nonnasopharyngeal carcinoma head and neck cancer patients, and healthy controls. We explored the relationship of plasma osteopontin and response to radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Experimental Design: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines HK1, HONE-1, C666-1, and CNE-2 were treated with 0 to 48 hours of hypoxia or normoxia, +/− reoxygenation. Osteopontin secretion in the supernatant was measured by ELISA assay. Cellular osteopontin protein and mRNA were detected by Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. Plasma osteopontin levels in patients (n = 66; 44 nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 22 head and neck cancer) and controls (n = 29) were measured by ELISA. Results: Hypoxia has no effect on osteopontin protein and mRNA level in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Only CNE-2 secreted osteopontin, and there was no significant induction by hypoxia. Plasma osteopontin levels in patients of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head and neck cancer, but not in locoregional nasopharyngeal carcinoma, were significantly higher than in controls. In patients with locoregional nasopharyngeal carcinoma receiving curative radiotherapy (n = 31), a high (>median) pretreatment plasma osteopontin level was a significant predictor of poor response to radiotherapy (complete response rate, 40% versus 88%; P = 0.009), which remained significant in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Our results suggested that the pretreatment plasma osteopontin level may be a useful biomarker of response to radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.',\n",
       "  'Background: Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP), a severe complication of mini-invasive esophagectomy, usually occurs during lymphadenectomy adjacent to recurrent laryngeal nerve. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) in reducing RLNP incidence during mini-invasive esophagectomy. Methods: Systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library until June 4, 2021 was performed using the terms “(nerve monitoring) OR neuromonitoring OR neural monitoring OR recurrent laryngeal nerve AND (esophagectomy OR esophageal).” Primary outcome was postoperative RLNP incidence. Secondary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for IONM; complications after esophagectomy; number of dissected lymph nodes; operation time; and length of hospital stay. Results: Among 2,330 studies, five studies comprising 509 patients were eligible for final analysis. The RLNP incidence was significantly lower (odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12–0.88, p < 0.05), the number of dissected mediastinal lymph nodes was significantly higher (mean difference 4.30, 95%CI 2.75–5.85, p < 0.001), and the rate of hoarseness was significantly lower (OR 0.14, 95%CI 0.03–0.63, p = 0.01) in the IONM group than in the non-IONM group. The rates of aspiration (OR 0.31, 95%CI 0.06–1.64, p = 0.17), pneumonia (OR 1.08, 95%CI 0.70–1.67, p = 0.71), and operation time (mean difference 7.68, 95%CI −23.60–38.95, p = 0.63) were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for IONM were 53.2% (0–66.7%), 93.7% (54.8–100%), 71.4% (0–100%), and 87.1% (68.0–96.6%), respectively. Conclusion: IONM was a feasible and effective approach to minimize RLNP, improve lymphadenectomy, and reduce hoarseness after thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, although IONM did not provide significant benefit in reducing aspiration, pneumonia, operation time, and length of hospital stay.',\n",
       "  'BACKGROUND: Delays in the diagnosis of children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) suggest the possibility of newborn screening as a way to identify children earlier. However, FXS does not have a proven treatment that must be provided early, and ethical concerns have been raised about the detection of infants who are carriers. This article summarizes major findings from a multisite, prospective, longitudinal pilot screening study. METHODS: Investigators in North Carolina, California, and Illinois collaborated on a study in which voluntary screening for FXS was offered to parents in 3 birthing hospitals. FXS newborn screening was offered to >28\\u2009000 families to assess public acceptance and determine whether identification of babies resulted in any measurable harms or adverse events. Secondary goals were to determine the prevalence of FMR1 carrier gene expansions, study the consent process, and describe early development and behavior of identified children. RESULTS: A number of publications have resulted from the project. This article summarizes 10 “lessons learned” about the consent process, reasons for accepting and declining screening, development and evaluation of a decision aid, prevalence of carriers, father participation in consent, family follow-up, and maternal reactions to screening. CONCLUSIONS: The project documented public acceptance of screening as well as the challenges inherent in obtaining consent in the hospital shortly after birth. Collectively, the study provides answers to a number of questions that now set the stage for a next generation of research to determine the benefits of earlier identification for children and families.',\n",
       "  'Spermatogenesis in the seminiferous epithelium of the mammalian testis is a dynamic cellular event. It involves extensive restructuring at the Sertoli–germ cell interface, permitting germ cells to traverse the epithelium from basal to adluminal compartment. As such, Sertoli–germ cell actin‐based adherens junctions (AJ), such as ectoplasmic specializations (ES), must disassemble and reassemble to facilitate this event. Recent studies have shown that AJ dynamics are regulated by intricate interactions between AJ integral membrane proteins (e.g., cadherins, α6β1 integrins and nectins), phosphatases, kinases, adaptors, and the underlying cytoskeleton network. For instance, the myotubularin (MTM) phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases, such as MTM related protein 2 (MTMR2), can form a functional complex with c‐Src (a non‐receptor protein tyrosine kinase). In turn, this phosphatase/kinase complex associates with β‐catenin, a constituent of the N‐cadherin/β‐catenin functional unit at the AJ site. This MTMR2‐c‐Src‐β‐catenin complex apparently regulates the phosphorylation status of β‐catenin, which determines cell adhesive function conferred by the cadherin–catenin protein complex in the seminiferous epithelium. In this review, we discuss the current status of research on selected phosphatases and kinases, and how these proteins potentially interact with adaptors at AJ in the seminiferous epithelium to regulate cell adhesion in the testis. Specific research areas that are open for further investigation are also highlighted. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.',\n",
       "  'The effects of larval and pupal thermal regime on adult transcuticular water loss rates and epicuticular hydrocarbon composition in Drosophila pseudoobscura were determined. Temperatures encountered by the larval stage had no effect, but flies emerging from pupae maintained at 24°C exhibited significantly lower cuticular permeabilities than those emerging from pupae maintained at 17°C. More than 50% of the variance in cuticular permeability was accounted for by variation in the proportion of n-pentacosadiene in the epicuticular hydrocarbons. High transcuticular water loss rates were correlated with higher proportions of relatively short-chain, methyl-branched alkanes and alkadienes. High proportions of longer chain lengths of both branched alkanes and alkadienes were associated with lower cuticular permeabilities. The molecular basis for these findings is discussed.',\n",

Data analysis included team coding and thematic analysis, guided by an a priori set of categories based on the study questions. Shared challenges and concerns included experiencing decline, managing pain and discomfort, and living with uncertainty. There was also congruence regarding end-of-life care preferences, specifically the importance of quality care, treatment with dignity and respect, and avoiding unnecessary life-sustaining treatment. Areas of incongruence included the elders' difficulties in accepting dependence, their fears of becoming a burden, and desire to be prepared for death. Family caregivers were most concerned with providing adequate care to meet the elders' physical and spiritual care needs. Open family communication was associated with greater congruence.

In search of an alternative to acaricides, joint action of Metarhizium anisopliae EBCL 02049 spores and 1-Chlorooctadecane was evaluated as a potential candidate for the management of Oligonychus afrasiaticus through natural products. In this regard, in vitro tests were performed to evaluate the interaction of M. anisopliae spores with multiple doses of 1-Chlorooctadecane (0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.2, and 4.0 mg/mL). Compatibility bioassay results evidenced from vegetative growth (77.7–84.40 mm), sporulation (5.50–7.30 × 106 spores/mL), and germination (96.70–98.20%), revealed that all the tested doses are compatible (biological index > 82) with the spores of M. anisopliae. The impact of combined treatment of spores with 1-Chlorooctadecane in different proportions (Scheme I, II, III, and IV) compared to their sole application against O. afrasiaticus was evaluated by concentration–mortality response bioassays. Results showed that all the combined treatments revealed high mortality compared to the sole application, which showed relatively slow mortality response over time. Toxicity recorded from Scheme IV combinations (80% 1-Chlorooctadecane: 20% Spores), exhibited strong synergistic interaction (joint toxicity = 713). Furthermore, potent interactions have overcome the host antioxidant defense at the final stage of infection by tremendously reducing catalase, and superoxide dismutase activities.

Always two silver ions were captured by one pyrrolo-dC–pyrrolo-dC pair as confirmed by melting experiments, UV and fluorescence titration experiments as well as ESI mass spectra. The silver-mediated pyrrolo-dC–pyrrolo-dC base pairs with phenyl residues in the 6-position were significantly more stable than those containing methyl substitutions. The caged silver ions are released from duplex DNA by sodium iodide but not by chloride or bromide anions, thus indicating very high stability of the metal–DNA complex.',\n",
       "  '(1,1,2,2-Tetrafluorobut-3-en-1-yl)zinc bromide was prepared by insertion of the zinc–silver couple into the CF2–Br bond of commercially available 4-bromo-3,3,4,4-tetrafluorobut-1-ene in DMF at 0 °C for 0.5 h, The resultant polyfluorinated zinc reagent was found to be thermally stable at ambient temperature and storable for at least 1.5 years in the refrigerator. This CF2CF2-containing organozinc reagent could be easily transmetallated to copper species, which underwent cross-coupling reactions with various aromatic iodides or acyl chlorides to produce a broad range of CF2CF2-containing organic molecules in good-to-excellent yields. Therefore, the zinc reagent could become a new and practical synthetic tool for producing functional molecules with a CF2CF2 fragment.',\n",
       "  \"Abstract This study compared children's and mothers’ digital media use and mothers’ mental health in two samples: one accessed before (Group 1; N = 257; M = 33.18 years; SD = 4.79) and the other accessed during (Group 2; N = 256; M = 33.51 years; SD = 4.96) the COVID‐19 pandemic in Brazil. Mothers of children up to 3 years old (Group 1: M = 17.95 months, SD = 9.85; Group 2: M = 16.48 months, SD = 10.15) answered an online survey. Bivariate analysis, factorial ANOVA tests, and multiple linear regression were performed. Results suggest that mothers’ and children's media use duration was higher during the pandemic only among children over 12 months. Mothers’ media use duration (β = .18) and mothers’ intention to offer media (β = .23) contributed to the explanation of children's media use duration (F(4, 474) = 16.81; p < .001; R 2 = .12; R 2 adjusted = .117). Higher mothers’ common mental disorders symptoms were also positively correlated to mothers’ intention to offer media to children both before and during the pandemic. Results suggest that interventions focusing on infants and toddlers screen time reduction should target maternal aspects such as mental health, maternal screen time, and intention to offer media, taking into account the mothers’ needs when planning these actions.\",\n",
       "  'The orientation in nitration of N-acyl derivatives of aniline and O-acyl derivatives of phenol in aqueous H2SO4 and in acetic anhydride has been studied. Acetyl and methanesulfonyl derivatives are exclusively ortho/para directing, whereas the N- and O-phosphorylated compounds yield in both media considerable amounts of the meta isomer. The observed differences in orientation are discussed in terms of different protonation sites and strong πp−πd interactions of the oxygen or nitrogen and the P(IV) atom.',\n",
       "  'Gene abnormalities, including mutations and fusions, are important determinants in the molecular diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms. The use of bone marrow (BM) smears as a source of DNA and RNA for next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables molecular diagnosis to be done with small amounts of bone marrow and is especially useful for patients without stocked cells, DNA or RNA. The present study aimed to analyze the quality of DNA and RNA derived from smear samples and the utility of NGS for diagnosing myeloid neoplasms. Targeted DNA sequencing using paired BM cells and smears yielded sequencing data of adequate quality for variant calling. The detected variants were analyzed using the bioinformatics approach to detect mutations reliably and increase sensitivity. Noise deriving from variants with extremely low variant allele frequency (VAF) was detected in smear sample data and removed by filtering. Consequently, various driver gene mutations were detected across a wide range of allele frequencies in patients with myeloid neoplasms. Moreover, targeted RNA sequencing successfully detected fusion genes using smear-derived, very low-quality RNA, even in a patient with a normal karyotype. These findings demonstrated that smear samples can be used for clinical molecular diagnosis with adequate noise-reduction methods even if the DNA and RNA quality is inferior.',\n",
       "  'Significance This paper proposes a simple theory, inspired by statistical mechanics, of the interplay of entropic forces and selective forces on dinucleotide frequencies in viral genomes that occur when a virus migrates to a new host. The theory is quantitatively developed, and leads to many predictions about statistical features of viral evolution. The approach is general, and could be easily extended to other genomic data and have wider applications. For example, an analysis of avian influenza entering the human genome has identified selection against CpG dinucleotides, which have been shown to trigger a response of the innate immune system and interferon production. We outline a theory to quantify the interplay of entropic and selective forces on nucleotide organization and apply it to the genomes of single-stranded RNA viruses. We quantify these forces as intensive variables that can easily be compared between sequences, outline a computationally efficient transfer-matrix method for their calculation, and apply this method to influenza and HIV viruses. We find viruses altering their dinucleotide motif use under selective forces, with these forces on CpG dinucleotides growing stronger in influenza the longer it replicates in humans. For a subset of genes in the human genome, many involved in antiviral innate immunity, the forces acting on CpG dinucleotides are even greater than the forces observed in viruses, suggesting that both effects are in response to similar selective forces involving the innate immune system. We further find that the dynamics of entropic forces balancing selective forces can be used to predict how long it will take a virus to adapt to a new host, and that it would take H1N1 several centuries to adapt to humans from birds, typically contributing many of its synonymous substitutions to the forcible removal of CpG dinucleotides. By examining the probability landscape of dinucleotide motifs, we predict where motifs are likely to appear using only a single-force parameter and uncover the localization of UpU motifs in HIV. Essentially, we extend the natural language and concepts of statistical physics, such as entropy and conjugated forces, to understanding viral sequences and, more generally, constrained genome evolution.',\n",
       "  'Objective\\nIdiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (ITN) can be effectively treated with radiofrequency thermocoagulation. However, this procedure requires cannulation of the foramen ovale, and conventional cannulation methods are associated with high failure rates. Multimodality imaging can improve the accuracy of cannulation because each imaging method can compensate for the drawbacks of the other. We aim to determine the feasibility and accuracy of percutaneous foramen ovale cannulation under the guidance of virtual navigation with multimodality image fusion in a self-designed anatomical model of human cadaveric heads.\\n\\n\\nDesign\\nFive cadaveric head specimens were investigated in this study. Spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning clearly displayed the foramen ovale in all five specimens (10 foramina), which could not be visualized using two-dimensional ultrasound alone. The ultrasound and spiral CT images were fused, and percutaneous cannulation of the foramen ovale was performed under virtual navigation. After this, spiral CT scanning was immediately repeated to confirm the accuracy of the cannulation.\\n\\n\\nResults\\nPostprocedural spiral CT confirmed that the ultrasound and CT images had been successfully fused for all 10 foramina, which were accurately and successfully cannulated. The success rates of both image fusion and cannulation were 100%.\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\nVirtual navigation with multimodality image fusion can substantially facilitate foramen ovale cannulation and is worthy of clinical application.',\n",
       "  'Background High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are structurally and metabolically heterogeneous and subclasses with differential effects on coronary heart disease (CHD) might exist. Apolipoprotein (apo) C-III, a small proinflammatory protein that resides on the surface of lipoproteins, enhances the atherogenicity of VLDL and LDL particles, but little is known about the role apoC-III on HDL. We investigated whether the presence or absence of apoC-III differentiates HDL into subtypes with nonprotective or protective associations with risk of future CHD. Methods and Results High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were measured in plasma separated according to apoC-III (by immunoaffinity chromatography) in two prospective case-control studies nested within the Nurses’ Health and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Studies. Baseline was in 1990 and 1994, and 634 incident CHD cases were documented through 10 to 14 years of follow-up. The relative risk of CHD per each standard deviation of total HDL-C was 0.78 (95% confidence intervals, 0.63–0.96). The HDL-C subtypes were differentially associated with risk of CHD, HDL-C without apoC-III inversely and HDL-C with apoC-III directly (P=0.02 for a difference between the HDL types). The relative risk per standard deviation of HDL-C without apoC-III was 0.66 (0.53 to 0.93) and 1.18 (1.03 to 1.34) for HDL-C with apoC-III. HDL-C with apoC-III comprised ∼13% of the total HDL-C. Adjustment for triglycerides and apoB attenuated the risks; however, the two HDL-C subgroups remained differentially associated with risk of CHD (P=0.05). Conclusion Separating HDL-C according to apoC-III identified two types of HDL with opposing associations with risk of CHD. The proatherogenic effects of apoC-III, as a component of VLDL and LDL, may extend to HDL. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2012;1:jah3-e000232 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.111.000232.)',\n",

       "  'Substantial efforts to redesign health care delivery are underway in the United States, including primary care, without attention to what has historically been known as “the personal physician.” The American Board of Family Medicine Foundation convened the Keystone IV Conference to reflect on the nature of personal doctoring and particularly what promises personal physicians might appropriately make and keep with their patients, going forward in new systems of care. This commentary describes the conference and its participants and provides an overview of manuscripts prepared by attendees that together comprise a written record of the conference. The authors conclude that a properly prepared and positioned personal physician practicing within a modernized primary care platform is a critical means of achieving better health and health care that is affordable, revitalizing the health professions workforce, and restoring population health in the United States. There is urgency to join with patients and colleagues to create the conditions under which people can have a personal physician of their choosing who knows them well, will stick with them as they wish, and be accountable for their receiving care that is appropriate for them as unique persons, with particular goals, preferences, and capabilities.',\n",
       "  'Microvascular density (MVD), a marker for tumor angiogenesis, has been demonstrated to have prognostic significance in various malignancies. Previous studies have demonstrated that MVD is an independent prognostic factor in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and that longer survival is associated with hypovascular tumors. The prognostic importance of MVD in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) has not been documented. We evaluated MVD in pancreatic NET and correlated it with clinicopathologic features and patient outcome to determine whether MVD is a useful prognostic indicator for these patients. Twenty-five pancreatic NETs from our archival files resected between 1981 and 2000 were identified. The mean MVD was determined for each tumor from the 3 most vascularized 200 × fields. Clinical follow-up ranged from 1 to 19 years, with a mean of 4.9 years. At last follow-up, 6 patients were dead of disease, 10 patients were alive without disease, 4 patients were alive with disease, and 5 patients were alive with disease status unknown. Mean MVD ranged from 43 to 527 microvessels per 200 × field. MVD did not correlate with tumor size, the examined histologic parameters, or patient outcome. MVD in pancreatic NET does not correlate with the clinicohistologic features evaluated in this study or with the patient outcome and is not a useful prognostic indicator in these patients. These results suggest that factors other than the simple number of microvessels are important in determining pancreatic NET behavior. However, most tumors were highly vascular, and additional studies may be helpful to clarify further the role of vascularity and assess the utility of antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of pancreatic NET.',\n",

       "  'The fetal development of the intestinal immune system is stimulated by the maternal microbiota, but it is still unclear whether viable bacteria exist in the healthy fetus. Analysis of such low microbial biomass environments are challenging due to contamination issues. The aims of the current study were to assess the bacterial load and characterize the bacterial composition of the amniotic fluid and meconium of full-term calves, leading to a better knowledge of prenatal bacterial seeding of the fetal intestine. Amniotic fluid and rectal meconium samples were collected during and immediately after elective caesarean section, performed in 25 Belgian Blue cow-calf couples. The samples were analyzed by qPCR, bacterial culture using GAM agar and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. To minimize the effects of contaminants, we included multiple technical controls and stringently filtered the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data to exclude putative contaminant sequences. The meconium samples contained a significantly higher amount of bacterial DNA than the negative controls and 5 of 24 samples contained culturable bacteria. In the amniotic fluid, the amount of bacterial DNA was not significantly different from the negative controls and all samples were culture negative. Bacterial sequences were identified in both sample types and were primarily of phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, with some individual variation. We conclude that most calves encounter in utero maternal-fetal transmission of bacterial DNA, but the amount of bacterial DNA is low and viable bacteria are rare.',\n",

       "  'Mycobacterium xenopiis an environmental pathogen responsible for pulmonary infections and tuberculosis-like disease typically found in patients with previous pulmonary disease. A sequence typing (ST) scheme was developed to classify and analyze sixteen isolates obtained from a prospective clinical study and subsequently extended to include five additional clinical isolates. Twenty housekeeping genes were sequenced and inspected for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Seven targets including atpD, fusA1, glnA1, pheT, secA1, topA, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were selected for continuing ST analysis, using the type strain ATCC 19250T as reference. Three isolates contained SNPs in glnA1 and pheT while the remaining 13 isolates displayed SNPs in topA. Consistency was observed with topA SNPs exclusively present in ITS subgroups B, C, and BC whereas glnA1and pheT SNPs were only evident in ITS A. Among the sixteen clinical isolates obtained from the prospective study, strain types (ST) ST4 and ST7 were most prevalent. Two patients with pulmonary symptoms, each with two isolates collected three months apart, displayed identical sequences in all target genes suggesting persistence of the strain causing infection rather than reinfection. We have described seven SNPs in six targets (atpD, secA1, fusA1, glnA1, pheT and topA) and ITS, which provide a typing tool to analyze relatedness between strains and a foundation for a genotypic phylogenetic comparison. This typing scheme represents a basic tool that facilitates the comparison of \\nM. xenopi strains to investigate the source and transmission dynamics between patients and their environment.',\n",

       "  \"There is a short-term up-regulation of β-adrenoceptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after reduction of central sympathetic outflow by clonidine in normal individuals. We have studied β-adreno-ceptor number and affinity on PBMC in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and multiple system atrophy (MSA; Shy-Drager syndrome) patients and age- and sex-matched normal controls (NC) before and after intravenous administration of clonidine, an α2-adrenoceptor agonist which lowers blood pressure predominantly by reducing CNS sympathetic outflow. Basal β-adrenoceptor density was high in PAF but within the normal range in PD and MSA patients. After clonidine there was a decrease in plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad) in PD, MSA, and NC, and an increase in growth hormone (GH) in PD, PAF, and NC. In PAF, NA and Ad remained unchanged. In MSA, there was no increase in GH levels. There was an up-regulation of β-adrenoceptors on PBMC at 30 and 60 minutes after clonidine administration, which returned to baseline values after 2 hours, and the affinity of the receptors was decreased in NC and PD patients. Intracellular production of cAMP after isoproterenol stimulation demonstrated that the up-regulation was not functional. Up-regulation after clonidine did not occur in PAF and MSA patients. The observed correlation of plasma NA and sympathetic defect with basal and clonidine-induced up-regulation of β-adrenoceptors on PBMC may provide insight into β-adrenoceptor changes in other tissues and also help in differentiating subgroups of autonomic failure patients.\",\n",
       "  'OBJECTIVES\\nThis study of directiveness draws on the literature on patient-therapist matching, neutrality, and resistance. Our aim was to investigate how psychotherapists conceptualize directiveness as an attitude, with a focus on pantheoretical aspects of directiveness.\\n\\n\\nDESIGN AND METHODS\\nOur data are narratives from 18 interviews with psychotherapists of different theoretical orientations (cognitive-behavioural, family-systems, humanistic-experiential, and psychodynamic), and from focus-group discussions with six other psychotherapists.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe analysis yielded four general themes: expression of directiveness (behaviour, agency, structure), its presence (depending on phase of and goals for therapy), its positive and negative outcomes (for patients and therapists, respectively), and therapist awareness (initial and shifting, depending on theoretical orientation).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nDirectiveness may be construed as an attitude. It supposedly increases via certain responses, but only a few of these are considered positive by therapists at large. Directiveness may be more present in early and late phases of therapy, and more warranted with patients that function poorly. There are both positive and negative outcomes of directiveness, but therapists are more prone to disclose the former.\\n\\n\\nPRACTITIONER POINTS\\nTherapist directiveness supposedly increases via advice, questions, clarifications, steering to topics, goal setting, self-disclosure, and session management. Directiveness is seen as more present in early and late phases of therapy. Directing is more warranted with patients who function poorly. Possible positive outcomes of directiveness are clarity, feeling of security, and saving time; negative outcomes are decrease of agency, increase of resistance, and less patient self-attribution of improvement. It is unlikely that therapists disclose adverse directive behaviours. Those who do, attribute them to psychotherapy structure if their attitudes are negative, and to personal choice if they are positive. This may hamper therapists managing their own level of directiveness.',\n",
       "  'Objectives: We investigated whether ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protects the right ventricular (RV) myocardium against ischemic injury in hearts treated with the specific mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD). Methods: Hearts from male Wistar rats (300 g, n = 39) were isolated and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and randomized to no IPC (control, n = 16), IPC (n = 16) or IPC preceded by addition of 5-HD (100 µm, n = 7). IPC consisted of 2 × 5 min of global ischemia followed by 40 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. The effect of IPC on RV myocardial infarct size was evaluated by measurement of the infarct size/area-at-risk ratio (RVIS/AAR). Postischemic RV function was evaluated by RV pressures. Results: IPC produced a marked decrease in RVIS/AAR (24.4 ± 8.1 vs. 42.6 ± 10.6%, p < 0.0001) and improved hemodynamic recovery of RV contractile function compared with the control group. We found no difference in RVIS/AAR (45.2 ± 4.4 vs. 42.6 ± 10.6, p > 0.05) or hemodynamic recovery between IPC + 5-HD and control hearts. Blockade of mitochondrial KATP channels by 5-HD abolished the cardioprotective response to IPC. Conclusion: IPC reduces RV myocardial infarct size and improves postischemic RV contractile function in the isolated rat heart, possibly through opening of the mitochondrial KATP channel.',\n",
       "  'Multi‐drug resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been reported in hepatitis B patients who received sequential antiviral therapy. In vitro studies showed that HBV constructs with mutations resistant to lamivudine and adefovir have marked reduction in sensitivity to combination of lamivudine and adefovir, whereas constructs with mutations resistant to either drug remain sensitive to the other drug. We conducted this study to determine whether mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same HBV genome in vivo and to describe the evolution of these mutations. Sera from six patients who had been found to have multi‐drug resistant HBV mutations to lamivudine + adefovir, lamivudine + hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), or lamivudine + entecavir on direct sequencing were cloned after nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of 215 clones from 11 samples with multi‐drug resistant mutations on direct sequencing showed that 183 (85%) clones had mutations to both therapies on the same genome; 31 clones had lamivudine‐resistant mutants only. Clonal analysis of serial samples from three patients showed progressive evolution from all clones with lamivudine‐resistant HBV mutations only to mixtures of clones that have multi‐drug resistant mutations and clones that have lamivudine‐resistant HBV mutations only, and ultimately all clones having multi‐drug resistant HBV mutations. In conclusion, mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same viral genome, suggesting that combination therapy directed against mutants resistant to each treatment may not be adequate in suppressing multi‐drug resistant HBV. De novo combination therapy may prevent the emergence of multi‐drug resistant mutants. (HEPATOLOGY 2006;44:703–712.)',\n",

Seventy eight pts had Class IV angina; of the 147 patients given propranolol, 41 were gradually withdrawn from propranolol and finally discontinued 24 hours before surgery, and 106 were abruptly withdrawn from propranolol 24 hours before CAG; 20 pts had left main coronary disease; 156 pts had cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time shorter than 20 minutes, and 16 pts had a CPB longer than 120 minutes. The operative mortality was 5.2% (9/172) for the entire group. Class IV angina (OM 7%), abrupt propranolol withdrawal (OM 6.6%), left main coronary artery disease (OM 25%), and CPB longer than 120 minutes (OM 50%), all significantly increased OM. These variables were interdependent, however, as many pts belonged to several predictor categories, combinations of predictors were examined, in order to more accurately predict the risk of individual pts. The combination of left main coronary artery disease and CPB longer than 120 minutes; and Class IV angina and CPB longer than 120 minutes were significantly associated with higher operative mortality. We conclude that Class IV angina, abrupt propranolol withdrawal, left main coronary artery disease and prolonged CPB are potent, interdependent predictors of OM in pts undergoing CAG. Consideration of these predictors, alone and in combination, allows effective prediction of OM for CAG in patients with stable angina pectoris.',\n",

       "  'between transverse process fractures and abdominal injury has been reported.[5] Although transverse fracture of the lumbar vertebra can be a marker of associated visceral injuries including trauma to the abdominal viscera, retroperitoneum, spine, long bones and cranium,[3,5] the fractures of the transverse processes of the lumbar spine can occur in the absence of other vertebral and visceral damage.[6] In literature, in patients with isolated transverse fractures, the detailed investigations are recommended to exclude these associated visceral injuries. Classically, the conventional lumbar radiographs are used for evaluation of patients who are at risk of injury from blunt trauma; however, it is relatively insensitive in detecting the fractures as well as associated visceral injuries.[3,7] This insensitivity of conventional radiographs, especially in the setting of acute trauma can be due to the presence of overlying bowel gas, hence the full assessment and extent of fractures and associated injuries is not possible. [1,5,7] With the widespread use of whole-body CT scanning in trauma patients, the isolated transverse process fractures has been increasingly recognized and apart form this, the CT scan can detect the associated injuries in detail.[3,5,8] As in the present case, the transverse processes of the lumbar spine, not associated with neurological deficits or structural instability, can be managed conservatively without neurosurgical or orthopedic intervention.[8] The detailed radiological investigations should be performed wherever facilities and resources permit.[3,8,9] In a large retrospective review at Level I trauma center, it was found that where no other vertebral fracture is seen on an adequate screening CT scan, investigation may reasonably end. Also further imaging and consultations can lead to prolonged log-roll precautions, which delay the mobilization and can be potentially deleterious to overall patient care.[9] This can be followed in a setting with limited resources (either the resources are not available, e.g. CT scan or inability to perform recommended investigation in all the cases, e.g. financial constraints and poor affordability) and clinically stable patients can be carefully observed over an extended period.',\n",

Identifying those patients who particularly benefit from TACE remains challenging. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) represents is an inflammatory protein described in patients with liver cancer, but no data on its prognostic relevance in patients undergoing TACE exist. Here, we evaluate MIF serum concentrations as a potential biomarker in patients undergoing TACE for primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. MIF serum concentrations were measured by multiplex immunoassay in 50 patients (HCC: n = 39, liver metastases: n = 11) before and 1 day after TACE as well as in 51 healthy controls. Serum concentrations of MIF did not differ between patients and healthy controls. Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients with larger tumor size, significantly more patients had increased MIF concentrations. Patients with an objective tumor response to TACE therapy showed comparable concentrations of serum MIF compared to patients who did not respond. MIF concentrations at day 1 after TACE were significantly higher compared to baseline concentrations. Importantly, baseline MIF concentrations above the optimal cutoff value (0.625 ng/ml) turned out as a significant and independent prognostic marker for a reduced overall survival (OS) following TACE: patients with elevated MIF concentrations showed a significantly reduced median OS of only 719 days compared to patients below the cutoff value (median OS: 1430 days, p = 0.021). Baseline MIF serum concentrations are associated with tumor size of intrahepatic malignancies and predict outcome of patients with liver cancer receiving TACE.',\n",

       "  \"Abstract A new payment system, the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system, and Korean diagnosis procedure combination (KDPC, per-diem) payment system were officially introduced in 2002 and in 2012, respectively. We evaluated the impact of payment system change from per-case to per-diem on high severity patient's length of stay (LOS). Claim data was used. A total of 36,240 case admissions and 72,480 control admissions were included in the analysis. Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series between cases and controls was conducted. Hospitals that consistently participated in the DRG payment system and changed to the KDPC payment system were defined as case hospitals. Hospitals that consistently participated in the DRG payment system were defined as control hospitals. LOS increased by 0.025 days per month (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0055) for 3 surgical diagnosis-related admissions due to the bundled payment system change. LOS among emergency admissions also increased and showed an increasing tendency under the KDPC. The LOS increase was observed specifically for complex procedure admissions and high severity cases (CCI 0, 1: 0.022, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0142; CCI 2, 3: 0.026, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0288; CCI\\u200a≥\\u200a4: 0.055, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.0003). Although both payment systems are optimized to decrease LOS, incentives to reduce LOS are stronger under the DRG system than under the KDPC system. It is worth noting that too strong incentive for reducing LOS is suitable to high severity cases.\",\n",
       "  'Abstract Although rare, postcardiac surgery nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a life-threatening condition. Identifying the risk factors for NOMI during immediate postoperative period may help early detection and intervention, which leads to improved clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify the clinical features and risk factors of NOMI for prognosis identification after cardiac surgery, focusing on immediate postoperative parameters. Among 9445 patients who underwent cardiac surgery over a span of 9 years, 40 NOMI cases (0.4%) requiring surgical interventions were reviewed. Suspected NOMI was diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy or computed tomography. To identify the risk factors, a control group (case: control\\u200a=\\u200a1:3 ratio) was randomly selected and compared using logistic regression models. NOMI was diagnosed after a mean of 8.1\\u200a±\\u200a9.6 days following cardiac surgery. Age (odds ratio: 1.16, 95% confidence interval: 1.08–1.25, P\\u200a<\\u200a.001), total vasoactive–inotropic score (VIS), and the maximal lactate level at postoperative day 0 (1.003, [1.001–1.005], P\\u200a=\\u200a.012), (1.23, [1.04–1.44], P\\u200a=\\u200a.011) were shown as risk factors. NOMI cases showed persistent hyperlactatemia without washout during the first 48 hours (P\\u200a=\\u200a.04). Thirty-four cases underwent exploratory laparotomy within a median of 10 (2–356) hours after the diagnosis, but only 17 patients (42.5%) survived. Compared with survivors, nonsurvivors showed higher total VIS at diagnosis, higher lactate levels during the first 24 hours postoperatively, and more frequently required extensive bowel resection (P\\u200a<\\u200a.05). Old age, postoperative high-dose vasoactive-inotropic use, and persistent high lactate level during the first 24 hours postsurgery were identified as risk factors for NOMI. Lactic acidosis and necrotic-bowel extent at surgical exploration were associated with poor survival.',\n",
       "  'Patient: Female, 67 Final Diagnosis: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma Symptoms: Atypical chest pain Medication: — Clinical Procedure: Liver biopsy Specialty: Internal Medicine/Oncology Objective: Rare disease Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a rare condition which typically occurs in males between 50 and 70 years of age, and presents with symptoms related to biliary obstruction including jaundice, pruritus, and dark urine. Other common symptoms at presentation include abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Case Report: We present a case of a 67-year-old female initially presenting with chest pain at rest, found to have a lung nodule on diagnostic imaging at the time of admission. On further imaging, a 9 cm liver lesion was incidentally discovered, initially suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma on imaging, with initial biopsy staining CK7 positive, and CK20 negative. The patient also had an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level. Biopsy results were later confirmed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusions: This report illustrates an unusual presentation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Although rare, cholangio-carcinoma is diagnosed most frequently as an incidental finding on imaging studies. With quick work-up and successful biopsy results, patients can undergo surgical or chemo-radiation therapy earlier, potentially leading to a longer survival time.',\n",

       "  'Parietaria-related respiratory symptoms. The other ®nding is that sensitization to pistachio nut allergens rarely induces severe clinical symptoms. In fact, symptoms were mild in the ®ve patients sensitized to pistachio nut. Unlike our two earlier patients, who frequently ate large amounts of pistachio nuts and had severe symptoms (3), the subjects described herein reported sporadic ingestions of these nuts and had mild symptoms. Thus, it is conceivable that a high intake of this food (be it as roasted nuts or as an ingredient of other foods) is related to a higher risk of developing allergic symptoms. Because of the low degree of serologic sensitization to pistachio nut in our patients, we did not do SDS±PAGE, immunoblotting, or RAST-inhibition studies. In conclusion, given the high frequency of Parietaria pollinosis in the Mediterranean area (5, 6) and the increasing consumption of pistachio nut, we suggest that patients affected by this disorder undergo SPT for pistachio.

       "  'Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pleiotropic cytokine playing critical roles in host defense and acute and chronic inflammation. It has been described in fish, amphibians, and mammals but was considered to be absent in the avian genomes. Here, we report on the identification and functional characterization of the avian ortholog. The chicken TNF-α (chTNF-α) is encoded by a highly GC-rich gene, whose product shares with its mammalian counterpart 45% homology in the extracellular part displaying the characteristic TNF homology domain. Orthologs of chTNF-α were identified in the genomes of 12 additional avian species including Palaeognathae and Neognathae, and the synteny of the closely adjacent loci with mammalian TNF-α orthologs was demonstrated in the crow (Corvus cornix) genome. In addition to chTNF-α, we obtained full sequences for homologs of TNF-α receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1, TNFR2). chTNF-α mRNA is strongly induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of monocyte derived, splenic and bone marrow macrophages, and significantly upregulated in splenic tissue in response to i.v. LPS treatment. Activation of T-lymphocytes by TCR crosslinking induces chTNF-α expression in CD4+ but not in CD8+ cells. To gain insights into its biological activity, we generated recombinant chTNF-α in eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression systems. Both, the full-length cytokine and the extracellular domain rapidly induced an NFκB-luciferase reporter in stably transfected CEC-32 reporter cells. Collectively, these data provide strong evidence for the existence of a fully functional TNF-α/TNF-α receptor system in birds thus filling a gap in our understanding of the evolution of cytokine systems.',\n",

       "  'The objective was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of an automated multiparameter line immunoassay system compared with other techniques for the identification of autoantibodies in rheumatic diseases. We studied sera from 90 patients. Anti-U1RNP, anti-Sm, anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B, anti-Jo 1 and anti-Scl 70 antibodies were identified by counterimmunoelectrophoresis(CIE) techniques, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting (IB) using extracts of rabbit thymus and human placenta, and an automated multiparameter line immunoassay system (INNO-LIA ANA UPDATE K-1090) that detects nine different antibodies simultaneously (anti-U1RNP, anti-Sm, anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B, anti-Scl 70, anti-Jo 1, anticentromere, antihistone, and antiribosomal P protein). The line immunoassay system equaled or surpassed the other techniques in the identification of anti-Sm, anti-La/SS-B, anti-Jo 1 and anti-Scl 70 antibodies (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94-100%) and was similarly effective in the case of anti-U1RNP (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 93.9%) and anti-Ro/SS-A (sensitivity 91.4%, specificity 87.2%) antibodies. In addition, this technique detected more 52 and 60 kD anti-Ro/SS-A sera than IB. Nine antibodies can be detected with this method at a cost of 25.38€ per serum sample. In five hours, 19 sera can be studied.The approximatecost of detecting these nine antibodieswith an automatedELISA system would be 28.93€, which allows 10 sera to be studied in four hours. In conclusion, the automated multiparameter line immunoassay system is a valid method for the detection of autoantibodies in rheumatic diseases. Its most notable advantages are automated simultaneous detection of several autoantibodies in the same serum and its lower cost compared with ELISA techniques.',\n",

       "  'Dear Editor, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious corona disease caused by novel coronavirus (Chen et al., 2020). Many infected people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate respiratory problems. While many of them recover without medical treatment, some do need more intensive support. Being well informed about this virus and how it spreads is the best preventive way to slow down its transmission (World Health Organization, 2020a). The most important recommendations from national states and the WHO include personal cautions such as frequent hand and face washing; maintaining social distance; avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth; practising respiratory hygiene, seeking early medical care. Besides, in the case of having fever, cough and breathing problems the general suggestion is: staying home and following healthcare providers’ advice (World Health Organization, 2020b). Hygiene behaviors, literacy level, media literacy and religious faith in one hand and less rational behaviours on another hand can be affected by the lifestyle and culture of the countries. Culture is a set of practices and behaviours defined by shared customs, habits, language, and geography by individuals. The concept of culture, and its influence upon individuals, is dynamic (Napier et al., 2014). Therefore, when individuals and societies change, these relevant aspects change subsequently. Furthermore, culture can be considered as an effective factor on life and health due to its effect on the way by which people deal with problems and solve them (Gorji et al., 2014; Rathod et al., 2020), Given that culture can be learned, shared or transmitted between generations, it can be reflected in social regularities (Kreuter & McClure, 2004). Culture can not only can assist in the prevention of epidemic diseases like corona, but can also be effective in treatment and recovery as long as the context is set for cultural influences and individual growth. When individuals get sick, they cannot treat themselves unless they have the capability, opportunity, and motivation to get adjusted effectively (Michie et al., 2011). Cultural guidelines provide a frame for the group’s social behaviour, which is more essential, especially, in communicable disease context (Antone & Csiernik, 2017). Cultural influences impact the degree to which individuals may follow hygienic recommendations like personal hygiene and quarantine more and help each other better (Sorensen et al., 2019). For instance, during the corona epidemic, public groups in the Islamic Republic of Iran produced and distributed hygiene materials. Although there was a severe sanction against Iran (Takian et al., 2020), in the Islamic Republic of Iran during such harsh conditions (corona epidemic along with international strict sanctions), different groups of people, depicted the culture of caring to each other and empathy. Many started to produce personal protection products such as mask and special clothing at home. Some people also voluntarily disinfected the urban streets and rural places. Besides, many required devices and materials were devoted to hospitals and coronavirus patients freely by people. As of March 29 2020, Iranian benefactors and charity organisations donated $83 m to support COVID19 relief (Tehran_Times, 2020). Overall, it seems essential to consider cultural contexts as an important determinant of the response to covid-19. We suggest that a new health agenda is needed at an international level led by the WHO to reflect learned experiences of cultural influences which enrich and support individuals with: observing personal hygiene correctly, helping each other, coping with quarantine depression, proper use of leisure time, prevention from malnutrition and obtaining news from valid sources.

CCTCC M209061 and enriched 27.5-fold with an overall yield of 0.4% by purification. The enzyme showed a homotetrameric structure with an apparent molecular mass of 104 kDa and each subunit of 27 kDa. The gene sequence of AcCR was cloned and sequenced, and a 762 bp gene fragment was obtained. Either NAD(H) or NADP(H) can be used as coenzyme. For the reduction of 4′-chloroacetophenone, the Km value for NADH was around 25-fold greater than that for NADPH (0.66 mM vs 0.026 mM), showing that AcCR preferred NADPH over NADH. However, when NADH was used as cofactor, the response of AcCR activity to increasing concentration of 4′-chloroacetophenone was clearly sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 3.1, suggesting that the enzyme might possess four substrate-binding sites cooperating with each other The Vmax value for NADH-linked reduction was higher than that for NADPH-linked reduction (0.21 mM/min vs 0.17 mM/min). For the oxidation of isopropanol, the similar enzymological properties of AcCR were found using NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactor. Furthermore, a broad range of ketones such as aryl ketones, α-ketoesters and aliphatic ketones could be enantioselectively reduced into the corresponding chiral alcohols by this enzyme with high activity.',\n",

Methods: We examined the patients clinically and immunologically. Results: We found diversity of clinical manifestations in both cutaneous and oral mucosal lesions and a high rate of inflammatory-type EBA patients in Japan. Common treatments were systemic steroids, followed by immunosuppressives, DDS, tetracycline/minocycline and colchicine. Immunological studies revealed that indirect immunofluorescence of 1M-NaCl-split skin, immunoblotting of dermal extract, and type VII collagen ELISA were sensitive methods, with possible multiplicity of circulating autoantibodies against other basement membrane autoantigens.

The two formats correlated significantly with each other and both were predictive of reading recognition as measured by the Peabody Individual Achievement Test. The data suggest that auditory discrimination as measured by the popular Wepman test may not be a pure perceptual skill but may be language bound. Consequently auditory discrimination as a pure perceptual skill may not be accurately assessed in bilingual or monolingual Spanish-speaking children if the Wepman test is used in its published format. A Spanish-based alternative is suggested for assessing auditory discrimination for uses other than reading prediction.',\n",

The controversy appears to lower the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and group subjects with TSH of more than 3 or even 2.5 mIU/L as SCH subjects. Objectives To assess SCH subjects both clinically using Zulewski clinical score and biochemically and to evaluate whether the euthyroid subjects with high-normal TSH (HNT) have any clinical symptom or subnormal biochemical finding. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study of 233 subjects, 67 with SCH and 166 euthyroidism, was conducted. Euthyroid subjects were divided according to the level of TSH as HNT (>2.5 mIU/L) and low-normal TSH (0.5–2.5 mIU/L). The subjects were examined for clinical feature including Zulewski clinical score and biochemical evaluations including thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) titer. The comparisons between groups were assessed using independent sample t test, and correlations between variables were evaluated using Pearson correlation. Results A significantly higher clinical score and higher frequencies of symptoms were found in the SCH group compared to the euthyroid group. The most frequent symptom was fatigue. Euthyroid subjects with HNT were found to have higher TPO-Ab titers than those with low-normal TSH, P < 0.05. The Zulewski clinical score was positively correlated with TSH and TPO-Ab titer but negatively correlated with the FT4 level, P < 0.05. Conclusions Zulewski clinical score is higher in SCH subjects compared to euthyroid subjects and can aid in assessing SCH subjects. A significant correlation exists between Zulewski clinical score and each of the TSH, FT4, and TPO-Ab titer levels. The frequency of TPO-Ab positivity is high in SCH. Additionally, euthyroid with higher TSH levels has higher level of TPO-Ab titer but not higher clinical score.',\n",

Computed tomography (CT) scan images have given the opportunity to compare with accuracy the real anatomic changes and potentially the functional improvements that resulted after a surgical treatment. Three-dimensional CT scan images processed by DICOM files in Dolphin 3D Software were used to assess orbital volume and surface in 12 subjects affected by craniofacial syndromic malformations treated with Le Fort III advancement. The preoperative (T0) and postoperative (T1: 6 months after surgery) three-dimensional craniofacial CT scans of the subjects were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Image segmentation of the anatomic orbital cavity and the three-dimensional graphic rendering were done by using the Dolphin Imaging Plus 11.0 software. The orbital volume was increased after surgery, with statistical significance, from 22,267 to 22,706.3 mm3 in the right eye and from 26,511 mm3 to 26,256.4 mm3 in the left eye. The surface of both bony orbits had an expansion, which is statistically significant. In conclusion, this study showed that the orbital advancement in white subjects after Le Fort III advancement was significant and produced a significant augmentation of the orbital volume and surface area with correction of the ocular bulb proptosis.',\n",

In this study, drug discovery of SARS-CoV-2 nsp-16 has been performed by a virtual drug repurposing approach. First, drug shape-based screening (among FDA approved drugs) with a known template of MTase inhibitor, sinefungin was done and best compounds with high similarity scores were selected. In addition to the selected compounds, 4 nucleoside analogs of anti-viral (Raltgravir, Maraviroc and Favipiravir) and anti-inflammatory (Prednisolone) drugs were selected for further investigations. Then, binding energies and interaction modes were found by molecular docking approaches and compouds with lower energy were selected for further investigation. After that, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried to test the potential selected compounds in a realistic environment. The results showed that Raltegravir and Maraviroc among other compounds can bind strongly to the active site of the protein compared to sinefungin, and can be potential candidates to inhibit NSP-16. Also, the MD simulation results suggested that the Maraviroc and Raltegravir are more effective drug candidates than Sinefungin for inhibiting the enzyme. It is concluded that Raltegravir and Maraviroc which may be used in the treatment of COVID-19 after Invitro and invivo studies and clinical trial for final confirmation of drug effectiveness.

       "  'The human and murine MOK2 ortholog genes that are preferentially expressed in brain and testis tissues encode two different Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins. In this paper, we show that the MOK2 proteins are mainly associated with nuclear ribonucleoprotein components, including the nucleoli and extranucleolar structures, and exhibit specific RNA homopolymer binding activities. Moreover, we have identified an identical 18-bp specific DNA binding sequence for both MOK2 proteins using a pool of random sequence oligonucleotides. The DNA binding domain is localized in the seven adjacent zinc finger motifs, which show 94% identity between human and murine proteins. Taken together, these results establish that the MOK2 proteins are able to recognize both DNA and RNA through their zinc fingers. This dual affinity and the subnuclear localization suggest that MOK2 may play roles in transcription, as well as in the posttranscriptional regulation processes of specific genes.',\n",

The allelic diversity ranged from two to 16 alleles per locus. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.000 to 0.971, and expected heterozygosity from 0.057 to 0.848. Thirteen of the loci were not in Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium, due to either the presence of null alleles, small sample size, or the effects of population subdivision (Wahlund's effect). All 37 primer pairs were tested with P. graminis and P. triticina showing that they are specific to P. coronata.\",\n",
       "  'Abstract 1. Prediction of biliary excretion is a challenge due to the lack of in vitro assays. Our laboratory previously demonstrated a highly significant correlation between in vitro IC50 values against mrp2 using rat canalicular liver plasma membrane vesicles and in vivo biliary excretion (Colombo et al., 2012). This study explores the possibility of predicting in vivo biliary excretion in human using membrane vesicles prepared from MDCKII cells transfected with human ABCC2. 2. In vitro MRP2 activity was determined by measuring the ATP-dependent uptake of 5(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (CDCF) in inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from MDCK-ABCC2 cells. CDCF uptake was time- and concentration-dependent (Km of 4.0\\u2009±\\u20091.2\\u2009µM and a Vmax of 7.8\\u2009±\\u20090.9\\u2009pmol/mg/min) and inhibited by benzbromarone and MK-571 with IC50 values of 1.2 and 7.6\\u2009µM, respectively. 3. A significant linear correlation (r2\\u2009=\\u20090.790) between the in vitro IC50 values from the described MRP2 assay and in vivo biliary excretion in humans was observed using 11 well-documented drugs covering low to high biliary excretions. 4. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that inhibition of CDCF uptake in MDCKII-ABCC2 vesicles not only provides a screening assay to assess MRP2 drug–drug interaction potential, but is also predictive of human MRP2-mediated biliary excretion.',\n",
       "  'BACKGROUND Paliperidone palmitate is a once-monthly injectable, atypical antipsychotic. To our knowledge, there has been only one report of paliperidone palmitate-induced angioedema presenting with acute laryngeal edema with subsequent respiratory arrest. Here, we present a case report of paliperidone palmitate-induced angioedema with a relatively mild clinical presentation compared with the previously reported case, and the patient’s condition was not complicated by life-threatening anaphylaxis. CASE SUMMARY A 79-year-old female, who had a major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease with behavioral disturbances. Paliperidone palmitate was off-label used to control her aggression, irritability, and psychosis. After induction doses (150 mg and 100 mg intramuscularly, given 1 wk apart), she developed intermittent swelling of the face, eyelids, and lips on day 17 after the initial dose, and the edema was explicitly seen on day 20. The diagnosis was paliperidone palmitate-induced angioedema. The monthly injection dose was discontinued on day 33 after the initial dose. The angioedema was subsequently alleviated, and it had completely resolved by day 40 after the initial dose. CONCLUSION Paliperidone palmitate-induced angioedema is a rare condition and can present with a mild, intermittent facial edema, which may be overlooked in clinical practice.',\n",
       "  \"Of the neurobiological models of children's and adolescents' depression, the neuropsychological one is considered here. Experimental and clinical evidence has allowed us to identify a lateralization of emotional functions from the very beginning of development, and a right-hemisphere dominance for emotions is by now well-known. Many studies have also correlated depression with a right hemisphere dysfunction in patients of different ages. The aim of our study was to analyze recognition of different facial emotions by a group of depressed children and adolescents. Patients affected by Major Depressive Disorder recognized less fear in six fundamental emotions than a group of healthy controls, and Dysthymic subjects recognized less anger. The group of patients' failure to recognize negative-aroused facial expressions could indicate a subtle right hemisphere dysfunction in depressed children and adolescents.\",\n",
       "  'Ovarian carcinoma, the most lethal gynecological cancer, is characterized by late diagnosis, with drug resistance limiting the efficacy of platinum-based therapy. Since some integrins are upregulated in cancer, including ovarian carcinoma, they represent a potential target for drug delivery. Receptor tyrosine kinases are also deregulated in cancer and their expression has been associated with drug resistance. Here, the antitumor effects of three conjugates possessing a selective binder of the extracellular portion of integrin αVβ3 covalently linked to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib were investigated in cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian carcinoma cells expressing both tyrosine kinase VEGFR2 and αVβ3 at different levels. We found that one of the three compounds was active in inhibiting the growth of both drug-sensitive and -resistant cells in the micromolar range with a slightly increased potency in resistant cells as compared to sunitinib. The same compound markedly impaired cell migratory and invasive abilities and reduced paxillin phosphorylation. Antitumor activity studies in IGROV-1/Pt1 cells xenografted in nude mice revealed a striking activity of this conjugate versus sunitinib. Taken together, our results support the interest of integrin-targeted sunitinib conjugates for the treatment of drug-resistant tumors.',\n",
       "  'In this paper I explore the possibility that tufted capuchin monkeys ( Cebus apella nigritus ) have food-associated calls, vocalizations that are functionally referential and may provide information about the presence of food to other individuals in the group. Functionally referential signals are those that meet two criteria: (1) they are context specific and (2) they elicit a response that is context independent. The study was conducted on a wild group of capuchins in a subtropical rain-forest in NE Argentina. To evaluate the degree of context specificity of the vocalizations I obtained focal animal sound recordings of the vocalizations emitted by individually recognized animals and indicated the socio-ecological context of call emission. I performed playback experiments to see if animals can respond to the food-associated calls in the absence of contextual information. Two vocalizations, grgrs and whistle series, were considered putative food-associated calls, because previous observations suggested an association of these vocalizations with the presence of food. Grgrs and whistle series were given at a higher rate when the focal animal was feeding on fruit at a highly productive source than in other socioecological contexts. Whistle series were also produced, although at a lower rate, in contexts other than feeding but whistle series given when feeding belong to an acoustically distinct type. Animals responded to the playback of food-associated calls with a rapid and direct movement to the speaker in almost 50% of the trials. Capuchins did not show this response to the playback of control stimuli. Food-associated calls in tufted capuchins can thus be considered functionally referential signals.',\n",
       "  'We studied the effects of aggregated amyloid β-peptide Aβ25–35 on spatial memory and the spectral-correlational characteristics of EEG of both the dorsal hippocampus and the frontal cortex both in adult and aged rats at the early stage of Aβ25–35 action. Spatial memory was characterized using a novel cognitive test. A decrease in low-frequency theta band oscillations in the dorsal hippocampus and the frontal cortex was observed. The mean coefficient of EEG cross-correlation between these structures was significantly reduced at the early stage of Aβ25–35 action both in adult and aged rats. In addition, we found that one month after Aβ25–35 injection spatial memory was impaired. These results suggest that the decrease in low-frequency theta band oscillations and the weakening of binding between the dorsal hippocampus and the frontal cortex under the action of Aβ25–35 may be an underlying cause of the typical memory breakdown associated with the Alzheimer’s disease.',\n",
       "  \"ABSTRACT Many proteins of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, contain characteristic arrays of highly repetitive immunogenic amino acid motifs. Diagnostic tests using these motifs in monomeric or dimeric form have proven to provide markedly improved specificity compared to conventional tests based on crude parasite extracts. However, in many cases the available tests still suffer from limited sensitivity. In this study we produced stable synthetic genes with maximal codon variability for the four diagnostic antigens, B13, CRA, TcD, and TcE, each containing between three and nine identical amino acid repeats. These genes were combined by linker sequences encoding short proline-rich peptides, giving rise to a 24-kDa fusion protein which was used as a novel diagnostic antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay setup. Validation of the assay with a large number of well-characterized patient sera from Bolivia and Brazil revealed excellent diagnostic performance. The high sensitivity of the new test may allow future studies to use blood collected by finger prick and dried on filter paper, thus dramatically reducing the costs and effort for the detection of T. cruzi infection.\",\n",
       "  'ABSTRACT A set of open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding signal transduction proteins are clustered around icfG, a gene implicated in the regulation of carbon metabolism, in the genome ofSynechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803. slr1860 is the ORF for icfG, whose predicted product resembles the protein phosphatases SpoIIE, RsbU, and RsbX from Bacillus subtilis. Bracketing slr1860/icfG are (i) ORFslr1861, whose predicted product resembles the SpoIIAB, RsbT, and RsbW protein kinases from B. subtilis, and (ii) ORFs slr1856 and slr1859, whose predicted products resemble the respective phosphoprotein substrates for theB. subtilis protein kinases: SpoIIAA, RsbS, and RsbV. In order to determine whether the protein products encoded by these ORFs possessed the functional capabilities suggested by sequence comparisons, each was expressed in Escherichia coli as a histidine-tagged fusion protein and analyzed for its ability to participate in protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes in vitro. It was observed that ORF slr1861 encoded an ATP-dependent protein kinase capable of phosphorylating Slr1856 and, albeit with noticeably lower efficiency, Slr1859. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that Slr1861 phosphorylated these proteins on Ser-54 and Ser-57, respectively. Slr1860 exhibited divalent metal ion-dependent protein-serine phosphatase activity. It catalyzed the dephosphorylation of Slr1856, but not Slr1859, in vitro.',\n",
       "  'Stereotypes and prejudice have been shown to bias information processing and decision-making. There are physical traits that are stereotypically associated with criminals (i.e. tattoos, dark skin-tone, facial untrustworthiness) and have been shown to influence juror decision-making. The current research aimed to investigate the effects of tattoos, facial trustworthiness and skin tone on juror case judgments and criminal appearance ratings, while also investigating and accounting for prejudice and motivation to respond without prejudice. Participants (n\\u2009=\\u2009426) were asked to act as mock jurors in a hypothetical assault case by making case judgments and responding to appearance and attitude measures. Criminal appearance ratings indirectly mediated the relationship between physical traits and verdict decisions. Additionally, a significant interaction emerged between skin tone and racial prejudice on criminal appearance ratings, suggesting that the effects of physical traits may depend on individual attitudes. Implications and future directions are discussed.',\n",
       "  'Simple Summary Butterfly wing color patterns are diverse, but they can be understood as modifications of the common scheme called the nymphalid groundplan. The discal spot is relatively small, but it is one of the important components of the nymphalid groundplan. Using many hindwing specimens of the family Nymphalidae, the morphological and spatial diversity of the discal spot was studied. The discal spot is expressed as a small or narrow spot, a pair of parallel bands, a diamond or oval structure, a large dark spot, a few fragmented spots, or a white structure. The discal spot is always located in a central portion of the wing defined by the wing veins, and this portion is sandwiched by a pair of bands of the central symmetry system, another important component of the nymphalid groundplan. On the basis of these results, the present study revises the nymphalid groundplan in minor points; the discal spot is an independent and diverse miniature symmetry system nested within the central symmetry system. Due to the involvement of wing veins to define the locations of the discal spot, the present study suggests the possible developmental dynamics of butterfly color pattern formation that produces color pattern diversity. Abstract Diverse butterfly wing color patterns are understood through the nymphalid groundplan, which mainly consists of central, border, and basal symmetry systems and a discal spot. However, the status of the discal spot remains unexplored. Here, the morphological and spatial diversity of the discal spot was studied in nymphalid hindwings. The discal spot is expressed as a small or narrow spot, a pair of parallel bands, a diamond or oval structure, a large dark spot, a few fragmented spots, or a white structure. In some cases, the discal spot is morphologically similar to and integrated with the central symmetry system (CSS). The discal spot is always located in a distal portion of the discal cell defined by the wing veins, which is sandwiched by the distal and proximal bands of the CSS (dBC and pBC) and is rarely occupied by border ocelli. The CSS occasionally has the central band (cBC), which differs from the discal spot. These results suggest that the discal spot is an independent and diverse miniature symmetry system nested within the CSS and that the locations of the discal spot and the CSS are determined by the wing veins at the early stage of wing development.',\n",
       "  'Purpose Early discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) may constitute a strategy of resource consumption optimization; however, unplanned readmission of hospitalized patients to an ICU is associated with a worse outcome. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score (SWIFT), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) and simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28) in predicting unplanned ICU readmission or unexpected death in the first 48 hours after discharge from the ICU. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in a single tertiary hospital in southern Brazil. All adult patients admitted to the ICU for more than 24 hours from January 2008 to December 2009 were evaluated. SWIFT, SOFA and TISS-28 scores were calculated on the day of discharge from the ICU. A stepwise logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these scores in predicting unplanned ICU readmission or unexpected death in the first 48 hours after discharge from the ICU. Moreover, we conducted a direct accuracy comparison among SWIFT, SOFA and TISS-28 scores. Results A total of 1,277 patients were discharged from the ICU during the study period. The rate of unplanned ICU readmission or unexpected death in the first 48 hours after discharge from the ICU was 15% (192 patients). In the multivariate analysis, age (P = 0.001), length of ICU stay (P = 0.01), cirrhosis (P = 0.03), SWIFT (P = 0.001), SOFA (P = 0.01) and TISS-28 (P<0.001) constituted predictors of unplanned ICU readmission or unexpected death. The SWIFT, SOFA and TISS-28 scores showed similar predictive accuracy (AUC values were 0.66, 0.65 and 0.74, respectively; P = 0.58). Conclusions SWIFT, SOFA and TISS-28 on the day of discharge from the ICU have only moderate accuracy in predicting ICU readmission or death. The present study did not find any differences in accuracy among the three scores.',\n",
       "  'Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus. Previous studies have shown that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses, including yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses, could be attenuated by serial passaging in human HeLa cells. Therefore, it was hypothesized that wild-type ZIKV would also be attenuated after HeLa cell passaging. A human isolate from the recent ZIKV epidemic was subjected to serial HeLa cell passaging, resulting in attenuated in vitro replication in both Vero and A549 cells. Additionally, infection of AG129 mice with 10 plaque forming units (pfu) of wild-type ZIKV led to viremia and mortality at 12 days, whereas infection with 103 pfu of HeLa-passage 6 (P6) ZIKV led to lower viremia, significant delay in mortality (median survival: 23 days), and increased cytokine and chemokine responses. Genomic sequencing of HeLa-passaged virus identified two amino acid substitutions as early as HeLa-P3: pre-membrane E87K and nonstructural protein 1 R103K. Furthermore, both substitutions were present in virus harvested from HeLa-P6-infected animal tissue. Together, these data show that, similarly to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, ZIKV is attenuated following passaging in HeLa cells. This strategy can be used to improve understanding of substitutions that contribute to attenuation of ZIKV and be applied to vaccine development across multiple platforms.',\n",
       "  'We studied the effects of thyroid hormone (T3) on nuclear protein-DNA interactions by using dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and DNase I ligation-mediated PCR footprinting. We examined an endogenous gene the growth hormone (GH) gene, and a stably transfected plasmid containing the chicken lysozyme silencer (F2) T3 response element (TRE) gene, F2-TRE-TK-CAT, both in pituitary tumor (GC) cells. The 235-1 cell line, which expresses prolactin (PRL) and Pit-1, but not the T3 receptor (TR) or GH, was used as a control. DMS and DNase I footprinting identified protected G residues in the Pit-1, Sp1, and Zn-15 binding sites of the GH gene in GC, but not in 235-1, cells. There was no specific protection of the tripartite GH TRE at -180 bp against either DMS or DNase I in the absence or presence of T3 in either cell line. However, T3 increased protection of the Pit-1 and Sp1 binding sites against DMS in GC cells. In GC cells stably transfected with a plasmid containing F2-TRE-TK-CAT or TRalpha, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression was T3 inducible and DMS footprinting revealed both F2 TRE TR-binding half sites in a pattern suggesting the binding of TR homodimers before and during T3 exposure. We conclude that the GH gene is accessible to specific nuclear proteins in GC, but not in 235-1, cells and that T3 enhances this interaction, although there is no evidence of TR binding to the low-affinity rat GH TRE. The presence of TR binding to the high-affinity F2 TRE before and during T3 exposure suggests that reversible interaction of T3 with DNA-bound TRs, rather than transient T3-TR contact with TREs, determines the level of T3-stimulated transcriptional activation.',\n",
       "  'The long-term results of aortic valve replacement were reviewed in all 88 patients with isolated aortic regurgitation and all 103 patients with isolated aortic stenosis who were operated upon at the National Heart and Lung Institute from 1963 to 1971. Survival curves were compared to determine whether any of 30 preoperative clinical and hemodynamic findings correlated with long-term survival. The indices that were of predictive value in patients with aortic regurgitation were found to be different from those in aortic stenosis. Symptoms, cardiac index, and cardiothoracic ratio did not influence survival in patients with aortic regurgitation. In these patients, survival was inversely correlated with the level of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP): six-year survival was 74% in patients with LVEDP ≤ 10 mm Hg, 41% with LVEDP 11-20 (P < .05), and 30% with LVEDP > 20 (P < .01). Survival also was lower in patients with aortic regurgitation who had elevated pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures, and in patients with electrocardiographic evidence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Using an LVH point score method (Romhilt-Estes), 56% of patients with a score ≤ 6 survived six years; 29% with a score > 6 survived (P < .02). Survival in aortic stenosis did not relate to any of the above, but did correlate with preoperative functional class. Five-year survival was 70% in class II, but only 40% in class III-IV (P < .02). Moreover, cardiothoracic ratio in patients with aortic stenosis correlated with survival in an unexpected way. Eleven of 31 patients with cardiothoracic ratio ≤ .45 had sudden unexplained death postoperatively, compared to only six of 72 patients with cardiothoracic ratio > .45 (P < .01). This difference did not correlate with postoperative hemodynamic measurements, including magnitude of the transprosthetic gradient. We conclude that certain preoperative indices are of value in predicting long-term prognosis after valve replacement for aortic regurgitation and for aortic stenosis, but that the specific predictive indices for the two groups differ.',\n",
       "  'The dorsal striatum is a major input structure of the basal ganglia and plays a key role in the control of vital processes such as motor behavior, cognition, and motivation. The functionality of striatal neurons is tightly controlled by various metabotropic receptors. Whereas the Gs/Gi-protein-dependent tuning of striatal neurons is fairly well known, the precise impact and underlying mechanism of Gq-protein-dependent signals remain poorly understood. Here, using different experimental approaches, especially designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) chemogenetic technology, we found that sustained activation of Gq-protein signaling impairs the functionality of striatal neurons and we unveil the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process: a phospholipase C/Ca2+/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2/cJun N-terminal kinase pathway. Moreover, engagement of this intracellular signaling route was functionally active in the mouse dorsal striatum in vivo, as proven by the disruption of neuronal integrity and behavioral tasks. To analyze this effect anatomically, we manipulated Gq-protein-dependent signaling selectively in neurons belonging to the direct or indirect striatal pathway. Acute Gq-protein activation in direct-pathway or indirect-pathway neurons produced an enhancement or a decrease, respectively, of activity-dependent parameters. In contrast, sustained Gq-protein activation impaired the functionality of direct-pathway and indirect-pathway neurons and disrupted the behavioral performance and electroencephalography-related activity tasks controlled by either anatomical framework. Collectively, these findings define the molecular mechanism and functional relevance of Gq-protein-driven signals in striatal circuits under normal and overactivated states. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The dorsal striatum is a major input structure of the basal ganglia and plays a key role in the control of vital processes such as motor behavior, cognition, and motivation. Whereas the Gs/Gi-protein-dependent tuning of striatal neurons is fairly well known, the precise impact and underlying mechanism of Gq-protein-dependent signals remain unclear. Here, we show that striatal circuits can be “turned on” by acute Gq-protein signaling or “turned off” by sustained Gq-protein signaling. Specifically, sustained Gq-protein signaling inactivates striatal neurons by an intracellular pathway that relies on cJun N-terminal kinase. Overall, this study sheds new light onto the molecular mechanism and functional relevance of Gq-protein-driven signals in striatal circuits under normal and overactivated states.',\n",
       "  'Primordial germ cells (PGCs) were demonstrated to be multipotential because of their differentiation ability in all embryonic lineages and because the pluripotential nature of PGCs caters for recent researches on stem cells. PGCs were cultured in suspension to form embryoid bodies (EBs). The characterization of PGCs and EBs was assessed by immunofluorescence technique, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and paraffin section for Haematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stain. We established a stable chicken PGC line in vitro and prepared masses of EBs from PGCs. We also demonstrated that PGCs expressed stage-specific and stem cell-specific surface makers: SSEA-1, SSEA-3, Oct4, and Sox2. EBs expressed specific genes from three germ layers: gene AFP from entoderm, gene GATA6 from mesoderm, and gene Sox3 from ectoderm. The HE staining illustrated that EBs developed different cell types; relatively larger EBs (440 µm in diameter) were obtained, which contract rhythmically. We concluded that chicken PGCs were suitable for the formation of EBs. Abundant larger size EBs could be prepared in an effective way with our protocol, which could construct a good animal model and provide a useful clinical platform in studying human embryonic development and cell transplantation field.',\n",
       "  'Objective Clinical presentation of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia may vary from asymptomatic occurrence or mild perception of palpitation to severe chest pain or syncope. This variation is the most challenging issue in the diagnostic evaluation of rhythm disturbances and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well. This study sought to evaluate the symptoms during the tachycardia attack or index event in patients who underwent electrophysiological study and ablation procedure. Methods This retrospective study included 100 consecutive patients who underwent electrophysiological study and ablation procedures due to supraventricular tachycardia. Structural heart disease, moderate/severe valvular pathology, systemic pathologies, such as connective tissue disease and chronic obstructive lung disease, history of pacemaker implantation was defined as exclusion criteria. In addition, medically managed patients and patients with unsuccessful ablation were not included in the study. Results Palpitation was the most frequently observed symptom in 84% of patients, followed by chest pain in 47%, dyspnea in 38%, syncope 26%, lightheadedness in 19%, and sweating in 18% of the patients. The most common symptoms after tachycardia event were fatigue and lightheadedness with frequencies of 56% and 55%, respectively. Forty-five percent of the patients reported more than one, unusually frequent urination within the following 1–3 hours after the index event. Conclusions Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia might manifest itself as gastrointestinal, neurological, psychosomatic symptoms, and unusual complaints in association with or without main symptoms, including palpitation, chest pain, syncope, and dyspnea. Symptoms after tachycardia or index event should be questioned systematically.',\n",

       "  'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia in clinical practice, thus, being the subject of intensive research both in medicine and engineering. Wavelet Entropy (WE) is a measure of the disorder degree of a specific phenomena in both time and frequency domains, allowing to reveal underlying dynamical processes out of sight for other methods. The present work introduces two different WE applications to the electrocardiogram (ECG) of patients in AF. The first application predicts the spontaneous termination of paroxysmal AF (PAF), whereas the second one deals with the electrical cardioversion (ECV) outcome in persistent AF patients. In both applications, WE was used with the objective of assessing the atrial fibrillatory (f) waves organization. Structural changes into the f waves reflect the atrial activity organization variation, and this fact can be used to predict AF progression. To this respect, results in the prediction of PAF termination regarding sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 95.38%, 91.67%, and 93.60%, respectively. On the other hand, for ECV outcome prediction, 85.24% sensitivity, 81.82% specificity, and 84.05% accuracy were obtained. These results turn WE as the highest single predictor of spontaneous PAF termination and ECV outcome, thus being a promising tool to characterize non-invasive AF signals.',\n",

Methods: Participants were grouped according to disability [Mental Retardation (MR), Cerebral Palsy (CP), Autistic Disorder (AD), Down Syndrome (DS), Other (OTH)] and age [2–6 years (n=24), 7–12 years (50 children) and 13+ years (62 children]. Caries examinations were carried out in accordance with WHO criteria and oral cleanliness was evaluated by visually assessing the presence of plaque on teeth. Results: The age range of patients was 2–26 years (mean age: 11.89±5.19 years). Mean dmft and DMFT scores by age group were as follows: 2–6 years: dmft=2.04±2.24; 7–12 years: dmft=2.24±2.60, DMFT=0.98±2.58; 13+years: DMFT=2.68±2.91. Overall, 15.4% of children had no caries or fillings. While dmft and DMFT levels (P>.05) did not vary significantly by type of disability, oral cleanliness did. Children with autism were observed to maintain the best oral hygiene and those with mental retardation (MR), the poorest. Conclusions: It is important for the dentist to concentrate on a preventive approach and provide proper dental education to parents of disabled individuals. Among the children with disabilities, more attention should be paid to the oral hygiene of MR group.',\n",
       "  'Choirs have been stereotypically gendered feminine in many national contexts. When gender-role conformity has been expected in such settings, male choral participation and performance has often been rendered gender incongruent and consequently threatening. Gender stereotype threat was explored as a factor which might instigate a potentially negative experience for adolescent males in New Zealand school choirs. The findings of the present study (a quasi-experiment conducted in a real-world setting across several cultural contexts) revealed that the performance of adolescent males in choirs was negatively affected by gender stereotype threat. Moreover, such threat was triggered by culturally-specific concerns about perceived peer expectations of gender-role conformity. The study also provided impetus to further explore the idea that stereotype threat could spill over from one domain to another. The findings add to the body of stereotype threat literature, and underline the important relationship between adolescent beliefs about gender-role conformity and music education.',\n",

Outcome measures included sleep quality and midsleep time. The capacity of ADHD subjects to comply with treatment using the glasses was assessed. Methods: Daily bedtime, wake-up time, and compliance diaries were used to assess sleep quality and timing during a baseline observation week and a 2-week intervention period. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered following baseline and intervention. The intervention protocol consisted of use of blue wavelength-blocking glasses and a moderate lighting environment during evening hours. Results: Partial and variable compliance were noted, with only 14 of 22 subjects completing the study due to nonadherence with wearing the glasses and diary completion. Despite the minimum 3-hour recommendation, glasses were worn, on average, for 2.4 hours daily. Lighting was reduced for only 58.7% of the evening. Compared with baseline, the intervention resulted in significant improvement in global PSQI scores, PSQI subcomponent scores, and sleep diary measures of morning refreshment after sleep (P = 0.037) and night-time awakenings (P = 0.015). Global PSQI scores fell from 11.15 to 4.54, dropping below the cut-off score of 5 for clinical insomnia. The more phase-delayed subjects, ie, those with an initial midsleep time after 4:15 am, trended towards an earlier midsleep time by 43.2 minutes following the intervention (P = 0.073). Participants reported less anxiety following the intervention (P = 0.048). Conclusions: Despite only partial compliance with intervention instructions, subjects completing the study showed subjectively reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality on multiple measures. The more sleep-delayed subjects trended toward an earlier sleep period following use of the glasses. Blue-blocking glasses are a potential insomnia treatment for more compliant subjects with ADHD insomnia, especially those with prominent sleep delay. Larger studies of blue light-blocking glasses in more phase-delayed groups could reveal significant advances in chronotherapeutics.',\n",

Saliva cortisol, blood pressure, state of mood, and relaxation were measured preintervention and postintervention. Stress levels were determined by validated questionnaires. All interventions were associated with relaxation responses in the variables saliva cortisol, blood pressure, state of mood, and subjective relaxation. No significant differences were found regarding the reduction of salivary cortisol (F\\xa0=\\xa01.30; p\\xa0=\\xa0.281). The systolic blood pressure was reduced best when walking was combined with balneotherapy or resting (F\\xa0=\\xa07.34; p\\xa0<\\xa0.001). Participants with high stress levels (n\\xa0=\\xa025) felt more alert after interventions including balneotherapy, whereas they reported an increase of tiredness when walking was combined with resting (F\\xa0=\\xa03.20; p\\xa0=\\xa0.044). Results suggest that combining physical activity and relaxation (resting or balneotherapy) is an advantageous short-term strategy for stress reduction as systolic blood pressure is reduced best while similar levels of relaxation can be obtained.\",\n",
       "  'Latent class analysis was used to examine patterns of victimization among a community sample of 212 women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV). Results identified three classes of women characterized by victimization history (recent IPV, childhood victimization); classes were further differentiated by IPV-related posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, other indicators of psychological distress, and substance use. Differentiating levels of victimization and their associated patterns of psychosocial functioning can be used to develop intervention strategies targeting the needs of different subgroups of women so that mental health and substance use problems can be reduced or prevented altogether. Implications for treatment and future research are presented here.',\n",
       "  'This study aims to investigate the influence of high linear energy transfer (LET) heavy ion (12C6+) and low LET X-ray radiation on apoptosis and related proteins of malignant melanoma on tumor-bearing mice under the same physical dosage. C57BL/6\\u2009J mice were burdened by tumors and randomized into three groups. These mice received heavy ion (12C6+) and X-ray radiation under the same physical dosage, respectively; their weight and tumor volumes were measured every three days post-radiation. After 30 days, these mice were sacrificed. Then, median survival time was calculated and tumors on mice were proliferated. In addition, immunohistochemistry was carried out for apoptosis-related proteins to reflect the expression level. After tumor-bearing mice were radiated to heavy ion, median survival time improved and tumor volume significantly decreased in conjunction with the upregulated expression of pro-apoptosis factors, Bax and cytochrome C, and the downregulated expression of apoptosis-profilin (Bcl-2, Survivin) and proliferation-related proteins (proliferating cell nuclear antigen). The results indicated that radiation can promote the apoptosis of malignant melanoma cells and inhibit their proliferation. This case was more suitable for heavy ion (12C6+). High LET heavy ion (12C6+) radiation could significantly improve the killing ability for malignant melanoma cells by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells and inhibiting their proliferation. These results demonstrated that heavy ion (12C6+) presented special advantages in terms of treating malignant melanoma. Impact statement Malignant melanoma is a malignant skin tumor derived from melanin cells, which has a high malignant degree and high fatality rate. In this study, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) can induce the apoptosis of malignant melanoma cells and inhibit its proliferation, and its induction effect on apoptosis is significantly higher than low LET X-ray; hence, it is expected to overcome its lower sensitivity to radiation. This study can provide theoretical basis for clinical trials, in which malignant melanoma is treated by heavy ion (12C6+), in order to accurately determine the clinical efficacy of heavy ion therapy. Clinical applications has revealed that local tumor control rate is high when heavy ion is used to treat malignant melanoma, indicating that heavy ion is an important direction in treating melanoma in the future.',\n",
       "  'Background/Aim: This study aimed to identify risk factors for recurrence of patients with stage III colorectal cancer by assessing clinicopathological features. Patients and Methods: The study included 231 patients with stage III colorectal cancer who underwent curative resection between 2006 and 2012 at the Department of Surgery of the Jikei University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Clinicopathological data of the patients were retrospectively evaluated. Results: The recurrence rate was 27.7% (64/231) in the study group. The univariate analysis for recurrence identified five risk factors: site of primary tumor (rectal cancer), surgical procedure (open surgery), preoperative serum CEA level (>5 ng/ml), preoperative serum CA19-9 level (>37 U/ml), and number of metastatic lymph nodes (over three metastases). The multivariate analysis for recurrence identified three risk factors: rectal cancer, preoperative serum CEA level >5.0 ng/ml 95%, and more than three metastatic lymph nodes. Conclusion: The risk factors for stage III colorectal cancer recurrence seem to be rectal cancer, preoperative serum CEA level >5.0 ng/ml, and more than three metastatic lymph nodes.',\n",

       "  'Abstract Purpose Colon cancer is one of the malignant tumors that threatens human health. miR-510 was demonstrated to play roles in the progression of various cancers; its dysregulation was speculated to be associated with the development of colon cancer. Methods One hundred and thirteen colon cancer patients participated in this research. With the help of RT-qPCR, the expression of miR-510 in collected tissues and cultured cells was analyzed. The association between miR-510 expression level and clinical features and prognosis of patients was evaluated. Moreover, the effects of miR-510 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer were assessed by CCK8 and Transwell assay. Results miR-510 significantly upregulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines relative to the adjacent normal tissues and colonic cells. The expression of miR-510 was significantly associated with the TNM stage and poor prognosis of patients, indicating miR-510 was involved in the disease progression and clinical prognosis of colon cancer. Additionally, the upregulation of miR-510 significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon cancer, while its knockdown significantly inhibited these cellular processes. SRCIN 1 was the direct target of miR-510 during its promoted effect on the development of colon cancer. Conclusion The upregulation of miR-510 acts as an independent prognostic indicator and a tumor promoter by targeting SRCIN 1 in colon cancer, which provides novel therapeutic strategies for colon cancer.',\n",
       "  'A proportion of patients with fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) develop a progressive phenotype characterised by decline in lung function, worsening quality of life and early mortality. Other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), there are no approved drugs for fibrosing ILDs and a poor evidence base to support current treatments. Fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype show commonalities in clinical behaviour and in the pathogenic mechanisms that drive disease worsening. Nintedanib is an intracellular inhibitor of tyrosine kinases that has been approved for treatment of IPF and has recently been shown to reduce the rate of lung function decline in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). In vitro data demonstrate that nintedanib inhibits several steps in the initiation and progression of lung fibrosis, including the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators, migration and differentiation of fibrocytes and fibroblasts, and deposition of extracellular matrix. Nintedanib also inhibits the proliferation of vascular cells. Studies in animal models with features of fibrosing ILDs such as IPF, SSc-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis-ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and silicosis demonstrate that nintedanib has anti-fibrotic activity irrespective of the trigger for the lung pathology. This suggests that nintedanib inhibits fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. A trial of nintedanib in patients with progressive fibrosing ILDs other than IPF (INBUILD) will report results in 2019. Nonclinical studies suggest that nintedanib, an approved treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, may have anti-fibrotic effects in other interstitial lung diseases with a progressive fibrosing phenotype http://bit.ly/2NiCAYx',\n",
       "  'SYNOPSIS. The macronucleus of the heterotrich ciliate Blepharisma undergoes a spectacular change in form in preparation for its division. The elongation phase of this cycle has been examined by light and electron microscopy. Coincident with elongation, microtubules appear closely applied to the outer surface of the macronucleus and parallel to the direction of elongation, and disappear as elongation is completed. It is demonstrated that the antimitotic drugs colchicine and podophyllotoxin reversibly block macronuclear elongation but do not entirely inhibit morphogenetic events including cell division. The failure of colchicine-treated macronuclei to begin or continue elongation is correlated with the prevention of formation, disruption, and/or disorientation of the extranuclear microtubules.',\n",
       "  'Background: The incidence of seizures in the neonatal period is thought to be high due to a lower seizure threshold of the immature brain. Data on seizures in extremely premature infants are scarce. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether seizures are an independent risk factor for in-hospital death and to determine the incidence of seizures in extremely premature infants. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Included were infants born under 28 weeks’ gestation and monitored with amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) over the first 3 days of life. The number and duration of seizures was retrieved from aEEG recordings together with clinical data. The association of seizures and other parameters with mortality was assessed using univariable analyses methods. Relevant parameters were used for a multivariable Cox regression analysis. Results: Overall, 229 infants were included in the study. Forty-six infants had at least one seizure episode yielding an incidence of 20%. In univariable analyses, gestational age (p < 0.001), birthweight Z-score (p < 0.001), seizures (p = 0.025), suppressed background aEEG (p < 0.001), and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; p < 0.001) were associated with death before discharge. In multivariable analysis, gestational age (HR = 0.61, p < 0.001), background aEEG activity (HR = 0.30, p < 0.001), birth weight Z-score (HR = 0.51, p = 0.04), and severe IVH (HR = 2.60, p < 0.001) were found to be significant predictors of mortality while the presence of seizures in the first 3 days of life trended to significantly predict an increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.53, p = 0.09). Conclusions: Although seizure incidence was relatively high in this cohort of extremely preterm infants and infants with seizures were more likely to die, seizures alone are not a predictor for early death. However, they may be an important indicator of pathologies that are not immediately diagnosed yet could eventually lead to death among this vulnerable population.',\n",
       "  'Sir: In the audit article on the use of clozapine in South Manchester (Seabourne & Thomas, Psychiatric Bulletin, 1994, 18, 618-619) 25 patients were given clozapine between 1990 and 1992 and, at the end of the trial, only ten subjects were still receiving the drug, the majority having been discontinued because of side-effects. I am interested in why patients who have started clozapine are then terminated. Neutropenla apparently accounted for only one patient and the other side-effects noted were hypersalivation, sedation, grand mal fits, myoclonic jerks, vomiting, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, acute confusional state with cognitive impairment, slurred speech, benign hyperthermia, dry mouth, weight gain, constipation, diarrhoea, hypotension, and urinary incontinence. The clue may lie in the mean daily dose of clozapine; around 445 mg per day for responders, 633 mg per day for non-responders and 356 mg per day for the side-effect patients. This dosage is markedly above the average UK dosage of around 300mg per day and our own dosage which is nearer to 200 mg per day. With the experience of around 70 patients in the community on clozapine I would say that these patients were probably receiving clozapine at too high a dosage. Apart from the case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and of neutropenia, these side-effects are dose related. If the clozapine is combined with an oral conventional anti-psychotic then any breakthrough psychotic symptoms can be usually managed. In this way most of the side-effects would have markedly reduced and, with regards to epileptic and myoclonic sideeffects that were not reduced, better control could be achieved with the addition of an anticonvulsant, e.g. sodium valproate. With these modifications we might have seen an improvement in the high final discontinuation rate of 32%. Another benefit of lower dosage is that patients are less likely to non-comply as they perceive an enhanced life quality. The authors mention that they are interested in maximising the response to clozapine so as to persuade the purchasers to spend more money on the drug. A spin-off from using combined clozapine therapy is that the cost is less and you can get more well patients for your money.',\n",

These bacteria could contribute towards sustainable agriculture with a focus on reducing excessive use of commercial fertilizers. This study aimed at investigating autochthonous populations of phosphate solubilizing and nitrogen-fixing bacteria from Lake Ol’Bolossat sediments. The total microbial counts ranged between 4.8 x 103 to 8.5 x 105 cfu/ml. A total of 50 bacteria were isolated, 34 were obtained from Pikovskaya’s agar medium while 16 were obtained from Norris Glucose Nitrogen free medium. Based on morphological and 16S rRNA gene analyses, the isolates were clustered under the genera Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, Fictibacillus and Acinetobacter. Among potentially novel strains, four strains NFDA2, PKGBC1 (MT799539), PKGB5 and SCEC2 (MT799543) belonged to genus Bacillus, three strains NFGA1 (MT799529), NFGA4 and SCDB3 belonged to the genus Pseudomonas, two strains NFEB6 (MT799528) and NFDC5 belonged to the genus Paenibacillus, one strain PKHC3 (MT7995441) belonged to the genus Arthrobacter while one strain NFDC4, belonged to the genus Acinetobacter. Generally, the phosphate solubilizing bacteria were the most diverse and genera Bacillus, Fictibacillus and Pseudomonas were the most dominant, however, nitrogen-fixing bacteria were dominated by genera Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas.',\n",

       "  'Background: Clinical pharmacist management of patients with diabetes has been well justified, but there is a lack of research that evaluates the impact of pharmacist-managed diabetes care versus standard medical care on American Diabetes Association (ADA) treatment goals other than hemoglobin A1c (A1C). Objective: To evaluate the reduction in A1C, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) for patients with diabetes whose care was managed by a clinical pharmacist and compare these values to those of a cohort of patients whose care was managed by primary care providers. The difference in percentage of patients attaining ADA treatment goals between the 2 groups was also evaluated. Methods: This retrospective chart review identified 98 diabetic patients managed by a clinical pharmacist with at least 2 A1C measurements between September 15, 2008. and March 15, 2011. The Military Health System Population Health Portal was used to identify a similar group of patients with diabetes managed by their primary care provider (N = 90). The Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application was used 1o collect baseline data and the most recent measurements for A1C, blood pressure, LDL-C, and documented immunizations. Results: The pharmacist group saw positive improvements in all primary end points, including a 1.6% reduction in A1C, a 9-mm Hg and 1.4-mm Hg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, and a 16.3-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C, Conversely, the control group had an increase of 0.8% in A1C and 1.5 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure. Reductions in systolic blood pressure and LDL-C were much less robust than in the pharmacist group (1.6 mm Hg and 5.2 mg/dL, respectively). Overall, patients in the pharmacist group were more likely to achieve ADA treatment goals. Conclusion: Pharmacist management of patients with diabetes significantly reduces A1C and allows more patients to meet ADA treatment goals. A clinical pharmacist-run diabetes clinic can provide numerous clinical benefits to patients.',\n",

This paper provides guidance on how a rapid review can be undertaken and discusses the strengths and challenges of the approach.\\n\\n\\nDESIGN\\nData from a rapid review of the literature undertaken in 2015 is used as a worked example to highlight one method of undertaking a rapid review.\\n\\n\\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING\\nSeeking evidence to inform health policy-making or evidence based practice is a process that can be limited by time constraints, making it difficult to conduct comprehensive systematic reviews. Rapid reviews provide a solution as they are a systematic method of synthesizing evidence quickly.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThere is no single best way to conduct a rapid review but researchers can ensure they are adhering to best practice by being systematic, having subject and methodological expertise on the review team, reporting the details of the approach they took, highlighting the limitations of the approach, engaging in good evidence synthesis and communicating regularly with end users, other team members and experts.',\n",
       "  'Matrix production during biofilm formation by Bacillus subtilis is governed by a gene control circuit at the heart of which are three dedicated regulatory proteins, the antirepressor SinI, the repressor SinR and the downstream regulator SlrR. Matrix production is triggered by the synthesis of SinI, which binds to and inactivates SinR, thereby derepressing genes for matrix production as well as the gene for SlrR. Recently, two additional regulators of matrix genes were identified: SlrA, which was reported to be an activator of SlrR, and YwcC, a repressor of SlrA synthesis (Kobayashi, 2008). We present evidence indicating that SlrA, which is a paralogue of SinI, is like SinI, an antirepressor that binds to, and inactivates, SinR. We also show that SlrA does not activate SlrR for expression of matrix genes. Instead, SlrR binds to, and inhibits the activity of, SlrA. Thus, the YwcC‐SlrA‐SinR‐SlrR pathway is a negative feedback loop in which SlrA indirectly stimulates the synthesis of SlrR, and SlrR, in turn, inhibits the activity of SlrA. Finally, we report that under standard laboratory conditions SlrA makes only a small contribution to the expression of genes for matrix production. We propose that in response to an unknown signal recognized by the YwcC repressor, SlrA transiently boosts matrix production.',\n",

Its comprehensive spectroscopic analysis revealed that it is a symmetric procyanidin tetramer composed of four (−)-epicatechin sub-units linked alternatively via 4β→8 or 4β→6 B-type interflavanyl linkages to form the macrocyclic structure. This NMR-characterized carbon skeleton has never been reported before for procyanidins in grape or in wine, neither in the plant kingdom. Surprisingly, the crown procyanidin tetramer appeared to be specifically localized in grape skin, contrasting with the oligomeric and polymeric procyanidins present in seed, skin, and bunch stem. Moreover, this crown procyanidin tetramer showed promising protective effects against amyloid-β induced toxicity.',\n",
       "  'Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction is accompanied by an increase in cellular oxidative stress in the pericardial coverings of the heart. Melatonin is a highly potent and efficient radical scavenger. Little research has been carried out concerning the relationship between this antioxidant and acute myocardial infarction in humans. In this work, serum levels of melatonin and parameters of oxidative stress, such as glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation levels were examined in light/dark periods in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Twenty‐five patients diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction were studied and 25 patients with no evidence of coronary artery disease served as controls. Venous blood samples were obtained from the patients and control subjects to determine melatonin, glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation; the samples were collected at 10:00 hr (light period) and 03:00 hr (dark period) in the first 24 hr after admission to the coronary care unit. Our results demonstrate the existence of differences between changes in melatonin levels in control subjects and acute myocardial infarction patients, revealing a reduced nocturnal elevation in the acute myocardial infarction group. Glutathione peroxidase levels were lower after acute myocardial infarction and did not show diurnal variations. In the control group, lipid peroxidation levels presented a light/dark pattern but in the acute myocardial infarction group diurnal variations of this parameter were lost. Our data show that acute myocardial infarction is associated with a nocturnal serum melatonin deficit as well as increased oxidative stress, suggesting that melatonin is, at least in part, depleted during the dark phase to reduce the free radicals formed in acute myocardial infarction.',\n",
       "  '[Purpose] The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the benefits and the basic principles of ultrasonographic examination in the evaluation of sciatic nerve injuries. [Subjects and Methods] Patients with sciatic nerve injury were evaluated using a real-time utrasonographic examination. The capabilty of ultrasonography in terms of determination of the type and the localization of injury, the position of the proximal and distal nerve segments, the presence or absence of a neuroma, and perilesional scar tissue were evaluated in all cases. [Results] Ten cases with sciatic nerve injury were evaluated with real time sonography. Perilesional scar tissue formation was found in 4 (40%) cases. Two (20%) cases had stump neuroma diagnosed by sonographic examination. The capability of ultrasonographic examination was satisfactory for all evaluation parameters.

       "  'ABSTRACT During the 2001 U. S. West Nile virus (WNV) season, 163 specimens were reactive in an in-house WNV-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were referred to either the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the appropriate state public health laboratory (CDC/SPHL) for additional testing. CDC/SPHL supplied results for 124 specimens that could be further evaluated in-house: 70 specimens were nonreactive in the CDC/SPHL WNV-specific IgM screening assay, and 54 specimens were reactive. These specimens were used to evaluate a modified in-house WNV-specific IgM ELISA that incorporated background subtraction to identify nonspecific reactivity and thus improve assay specificity. Of the 70 CDC/SPHL nonreactive samples, 49 (70%) were nonreactive in the modified ELISA; of the 54 CDC/SPHL reactive samples, 51 (94%) were reactive in the modified ELISA. Confirmatory studies performed by CDC/SPHL indicated that 38 CDC/SPHL screen-reactive specimens represented true WNV infection; all 38 specimens were reactive in the modified in-house WNV-specific IgM ELISA. These findings demonstrate that an in-house ELISA system for WNV-specific IgM effectively identifies patients with WNV infection.',\n",
       "  'African Americans with hypertension are at high risk for adverse outcomes from cardiovascular and renal disease. Patients with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease have a high prevalence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. Our goal was to study prospectively the relationships of LV mass and diastolic function with subsequent cardiovascular and renal outcomes in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension cohort study. Of 691 patients enrolled in the cohort, 578 had interpretable echocardiograms and complete relevant clinical data. Exposures were LV hypertrophy and diastolic parameters. Outcomes were cardiovascular events requiring hospitalization or causing death; a renal composite outcome of doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease (censoring death); and heart failure. We found strong independent relationships between LV hypertrophy and subsequent cardiovascular (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.27) events, but not renal outcomes. After adjustment for LV mass and clinical variables, lower systolic tissue Doppler velocities and diastolic parameters reflecting a less compliant LV (shorter deceleration time and abnormal E/A ratio) were significantly (P<0.05) associated with future heart failure events. This is the first study to show a strong relationship among LV hypertrophy, diastolic parameters, and adverse cardiac outcomes in African Americans with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. These echocardiographic risk factors may help identify high-risk patients with chronic kidney disease for aggressive therapeutic intervention.',\n",
       "  'Purpose Current methods to predict carotid stenosis from ultrasound duplex criteria involve assigning a category of stenosis on the basis of an individual laboratory-defined combination of peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and ratio of internal carotid artery velocity to common carotid artery velocity. This study will define a formula by use of regression analysis of the duplex ultrasound criteria compared with the angiographic results. This study will then compare the formula predictions of stenosis with the current means of combining categories to determine whether there is an increase in accuracy and correlation with angiographic findings. Methods A retrospective review of the duplex scans and NASCET-defined angiogram results from 209 patent carotid arteries in 114 patients over the course of 4 yr at a single institution was performed. Regression analysis comparing each of the PSV, EDV, and internal carotid artery/common carotid artery ratios (RATIO) with angiographic stenosis was performed. Simple and multiple linear regression equations were obtained. The equation was tested for validity. The data were then reanalyzed by use of the formulas, and predicted stenoses from the formulas were obtained. The formula-predicted stenoses (F1 and F2), category-based stenoses (READAS), and angiographic stenoses were compared. A determination was then made of their statistically significant difference by use of the Wilcoxon signed rank test and receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. Results An r2 value of 0.7231, 0.6341, and 0.7262 was obtained, respectively, for the equations comparing PSV, EDV, and ICA/CCA ratio with angiographic stenosis. Limiting the data to stenosis >30% resulted in correlation coefficients between the regression formula predicted data and the angiographic data of 0.71. A statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the category results and angiography (p < 0.0001). No statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the formula-predicted data and the angiographic data. ROC analysis and Area (AZ) test demonstrated a statistically significant difference and better prediction of a >60% stenosis by the regression equation than by the current category method (p < 0.05). Conclusion Regression analysis of duplex data versus NASCET-defined angiographic findings allows formation of a model to predict carotid stenosis. This can be done with greater accuracy than the commonly accepted means of categorizing the duplex results.',\n",
       "  'Sleep disturbances are among the common nonmotor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sleep can be disrupted by nocturnal motor and nonmotor symptoms and other comorbid sleep disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) causes sleep-related injury, has important clinical implications as a harbinger of PD and predicts a progressive clinical phenotype. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its related symptoms can impair sleep initiation. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a refractory problem affecting patients’ daytime activities. In particular, during the COVID-19 era, special attention should be paid to monitoring sleep problems, as infection-prevention procedures for COVID-19 can affect patients’ motor symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and sleep. Therefore, screening for and managing sleep problems is important in clinical practice, and the maintenance of good sleep conditions may improve the quality of life of PD patients.

       "  'Concept: No consensus exists regarding the magnitude of the risk of noise‐induced hearing loss (NIHL) associated with leisure noise, in particular, personal listening devices in young adults. Objective: Examine the magnitude of hearing loss associated with personal listening devices and other sources of leisure noise in causing NIHL in young adults. Study Design: Prospective auditory testing of college student volunteers with retrospective history exposure to home stereos, personal listening devices, firearms, and other sources of recreational noise. Methods: Subjects underwent audiologic examination consisting of estimation of pure‐tone thresholds, speech reception thresholds, and word recognition at 45 dB HL. Results: Fifty subjects aged 18 to 30 years were tested. All hearing thresholds of all subjects (save one—a unilateral 30 dB HL threshold at 6 kHz) were normal, (i.e., 25 dB HL or better). A 10 dB threshold elevation (notch) in either ear at 3 to 6 kHz as compared with neighboring frequencies was noted in 11 (22%) subjects and an unequivocal notch (15 dB or greater) in either ear was noted in 14 (28%) of subjects. The presence or absence of any notch (small or large) did not correlate with any single or cumulative source of noise exposure. No difference in pure‐tone threshold, speech reception threshold, or speech discrimination was found among subjects when segregated by noise exposure level. Conclusion: The majority of young users of personal listening devices are at low risk for substantive NIHL. Interpretation of the significance of these findings in relation to noise exposure must be made with caution. NIHL is an additive process and even subtle deficits may contribute to unequivocal hearing loss with continued exposure. The low prevalence of measurable deficits in this study group may not exclude more substantive deficits in other popu lations with greater exposures. Continued education of young people about the risk to hearing from recreational noise exposure is warranted.',\n",
       "  'Abstract Background C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations are associated with morbidity and mortality in breast cancer patients and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may help regulate CRP levels. Purpose The purpose of this prospective study was to examine intraindividual and interindividual changes in MVPA on changes in CRP levels among early posttreatment breast cancer patients. Methods During five data collections over the first year posttreatment for breast cancer, women (N = 138, Mage = 55.3, standard deviation = 11.1 years) completed a questionnaire, wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure MVPA, and provided blood samples to measure CRP concentrations. Intraindividual and interindividual associations between MVPA on CRP were tested using hierarchical linear modeling. Results Based on the intraindividual associations, lower concentrations of CRP were evident when participants engaged in more, as compared to their average, MVPA (β = −.02, p < .021). In addition, interindividual analyses showed that women who engaged in more MVPA across the study period had lower concentrations of CRP compared to women who engaged in less MVPA (β = −.24, p = .006). Conclusions MVPA in breast cancer patients is consistently associated with lower CRP concentrations over time.

Patients with diabetes and insulin resistance are at even greater risk than the general population. Risk factors may be even more significant in predicting risk of disease when present in diabetic patients. Interaction among the elements of the metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance (MS/IR) in atherogenesis is currently the subject of much research. Efforts to understand the elements of the dyslipidemias associated with MS/IR are now beginning to pay off. An increasing number of drugs and other interventions have been shown to be effective in clinical trials in reducing risk factors and improving outcomes. The advantages and disadvantages of possible treatments of these dyslipidemias, including the risks and benefits of combination therapy, are discussed in detail. Finally, strategies for maintaining glucose control and the role of inflammation associated with MS/IR and CVD are described.',\n",
       "  'Background Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) have provided a new method for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the role of IGRAs for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB), especially in HIV-infected patients remains unclear. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify studies published in January 2001–July 2011 that evaluated the evidence of using QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT) on blood for the diagnosis of active TB in HIV-infected patients. Results The search identified 16 eligible studies that included 2801 HIV-infected individuals (637 culture confirmed TB cases). The pooled sensitivity for the diagnosis of active TB was 76.7% (95%CI, 71.6–80.5%) and 77.4% (95%CI, 71.4–82.6%) for QFT-GIT and T-SPOT, respectively, while the specificity was 76.1% (95%CI, 74.0–78.0%) and 63.1% (95%CI, 57.6–68.3%) after excluding the indeterminate results. Studies conducted in low/middle income countries showed slightly lower sensitivity and specificity when compared to that in high-income countries. The proportion of indeterminate results was as high as 10% (95%CI, 8.8–11.3%) and 13.2% (95%CI, 10.6–16.0%) for QFT-GIT and T-SPOT, respectively. Conclusion IGRAs in their current formulations have limited accuracy in diagnosing active TB in HIV-infected patients, and should not be used alone to rule out or rule in active TB cases in HIV-infected patients. Further modification is needed to improve their accuracy.',\n",

       "  \"ABSTRACT Microbial resistance is an increasing health concern and a true danger to human well-being. A worldwide search for new compounds is ongoing, and antimicrobial peptides are promising lead candidates for tomorrow's antibiotics. The decapeptide anoplin (GLLKRIKTLL-NH2) is an especially interesting candidate because of its small size as well as its antimicrobial and nonhemolytic properties. Optimization of the properties of an antimicrobial peptide such as anoplin requires multidimensional searching in a complex chemical space. Typically, such optimization is performed by labor-intensive and costly trial-and-error methods. In this study, we show the benefit of fractional factorial design for identification of the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix. We synthesized and analyzed a training set of 12 anoplin analogs, representative of 64 analogs in total. Using MIC, hemolysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time data, we constructed analysis-of-variance models that describe the relationship between these properties and the structural characteristics of the analogs. We show that the mathematical models derived from the training set data can be used to predict the properties of other analogs in the chemical space. Hence, this method provides an efficient means of identification of the optimal peptide in the searched chemical space.\",\n",
       "  'ABSTRACT Evidence for the health benefits of breastfeeding is well substantiated but breastfeeding uptake and duration remains low worldwide. Individual level breastfeeding promotion programmes are behavioural interventions, targeting malleable social-psychological processes to change behaviour. This systematic review aimed to investigate whether such interventions are effective at improving breastfeeding initiation, duration and exclusivity, and breastfeeding support. A three-stage search strategy identified eligible articles from six databases. Nine controlled-clinical trials and 11 quasi-experimental trials were included. Random-effects meta-analyses identified significant improvements in rates of breastfeeding initiation (N\\u2009=\\u20092,213; OR\\u2009=\\u20092.32, 95% CI [1.33, 4.03], p\\u2009=\\u2009.003; I 2\\u2009=\\u20090%, p\\u2009=\\u2009.966) and suggested improved exclusive breastfeeding rates up to six months postpartum (N\\u2009=\\u20093,671; OR\\u2009=\\u20091.84, 95% CI [1.38, 2.45], p\\u2009<\\u2009.001; I 2\\u2009=\\u200968.7%, p\\u2009<\\u2009.001). After considering small-sample effects, estimates for exclusive breastfeeding across the postpartum period were non-significant. There were no improvements in women maintaining any (i.e., non-exclusive) breastfeeding to one, two, three, four or six months postpartum (N\\u2009=\\u20094,153; OR\\u2009=\\u20090.88, 95% CI [0.72, 1.09], p\\u2009=\\u2009.253). Evidence for improvements in perceived and actual breastfeeding support was limited. Sub-group analyses suggest standalone postnatal interventions targeting first-time mothers may support breastfeeding uptake. Findings should be interpreted cautiously as the quality of evidence for each outcome was low with a high risk of bias. Future efforts to support women to breastfeed should assimilate behaviour change research, with process evaluation to identify effective processes to inform a high-quality evidence-base for implementation in practice.',\n",
       "  'ABSTRACT Introduction: Synovial Sarcoma (SS) and Myxoid Round Cell Liposarcoma (MRCL) are devastating sarcoma subtypes with few treatment options and poor outcomes in the advanced setting. However, both these diseases may be ideal for novel immunotherapies targeting the cancer-testis antigen, NY-ESO-1. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the novel NY-ESO-1 targeted vaccine regimen, CMB305. This regimen uses a unique integration-deficient, dendritic-cell targeting lentiviral vector from the ZVex® platform, LV305, in order to prime NY-ESO-1 specific T cells. LV305 has single agent activity, and, in one case, caused a durable partial response in a refractory SS patient. CMB305 also includes a boost from a NY-ESO-1 protein vaccine given along with a potent toll-like-4 receptor agonist, glycopyranosyl lipid A. CMB305 induces NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses in both SS and MRC patients and these patients had excellent overall survival (OS) outcomes in the initial phase I study. Expert commentary: CMB305 is a therapeutic vaccine regimen targeting NY-ESO-1 based on the lentiviral vaccine vector, LV305. Phase I studies have proven this vaccine is active immunologically. Data suggesting this vaccine may improve OS for SS and MRCL patients is exciting but early, and on-going work is testing the impact of CMB305 on patient outcomes.',\n",

       "  'Mefenamic acid (MFA), a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has a low oral bioavailability due to poor aqueous solubility and insufficient dissolution. In order to improve the same, various techniques were employed viz., evaporative precipitation into aqueous solution (EPAS), spherical agglomeration (SA) and solid dispersion using solvent evaporation and melt mixing. The formulations were characterised by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray powder diffractometry (XRD) and were investigated for drug content studies, solubility studies, in vitro study and in vivo evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity. The formulations of MFA prepared by spherical agglomeration technique have satisfactory good drug content and the formulations with SLS and HPMC show a significant increase in solubility in case of SA technique. In case of solid dispersion, all carriers show improvement in the dissolution rate of the drug The DSC studies show no change in the polymorphism in most of the formulations The XRD studies of the formulations show no change in their crystalline form. The formulation containing HPMC & SLS as drug carrier show better anti-inflammatory effect with comparison to pure drug confirming the improved bioavailability of this drug.',\n",

Methods This was a retrospective interventional analysis of 7 eyes of 6 patients within 3 months of injury with simultaneous/subsequent surgical procedures to salvage globe integrity. Results Of 7 included eyes, both eyes of one patient underwent phthisical changes. In one eye, the retinal detachment was inoperable; in another, the retina was reattached with silicone oil tamponade, and underwent subsequent Boston type 1 keratoprosthesis with a final best-corrected visual acuity of 20/80 at 3-year follow-up. One eye underwent Lucia type 2 keratoprosthesis, one eye the modified osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis procedure, with visual recovery of 20/120 and 20/80, respectively, and one maintained vision of 20/200 for 2 years following a penetrating keratoplasty. The final best-corrected visual acuity was better than 20/200 in 4 out of these 7 eyes (57.14%). Conclusions In acute severe chemical injuries, corneal perforation with scleral ischemia can threaten globe integrity as well as preclude routine tectonic penetrating procedure. Presence of a concurrent retinal detachment in this setting further complicates the approach as well as the outcome. The use of a large tectonic corneoscleral lamellar graft provides a viable option in the achievement of tectonic stability in these eyes, facilitating future visual rehabilitative procedures.',\n",
       "  'PSGL‐1 is a mucin‐like glycoprotein that supports, in mammals, leukocyte rolling on selectins. However, we have limited knowledge whether its function is conserved in non‐mammals and how its structure adapted during evolution. To identify conserved amino acid sequences required for selectin binding, we performed multiple alignments of PSGL‐1 sequences from 18 mammals, 4 birds, 3 reptiles, 1 amphibian, and 15 fishes. The amino‐terminal T[D/E]PP[D/E] motif, which identifies in mammals a core‐2 O‐glycosylated threonine required for selectin‐binding, is partially conserved in some fishes (e.g., T. rubripes) and birds (e.g., G. gallus), however, most non‐mammals do not display it. The sulfated tyrosine residues of human PSGL‐1, which bind L‐ and P‐selectin, are not observed in non‐mammals, suggesting that they are dispensable for selectin‐binding or that other amino acids play their role. A mucin‐like domain is present in all species. Interestingly, the alignment of cytoplasmic sequences of non‐mammals reveals the conservation of ezrin/radixin/moesin binding site and two new motifs (M1 and M2). To examine the conservation of PSGL‐1 function, we cloned PSGL‐1 cDNA sequences of zebrafish and fugu, and established their cross‐reactivity with human selectins under flow conditions. Importantly, deleting the well‐conserved M1 motif strongly decreased PSGL‐1 expression at leukocyte surface and induced retention of the precursor molecule in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that M1 motif provides a signal required to export PSGL‐1 precursors to the Golgi complex. These data show for the first time the conservation of PSGL‐1 function from fishes to mammals and reveal the function of a new motif.',\n",

The key objective of FIA treatment is to achieve a balance between high healing rates and continence preservation. Lay open fistulotomy can result in a success rate of up to 100% but this is at the expense of continence especially in the complex fistula. Recently, several sphincter saving surgical procedures have been advocated for the treatments of FIA with acceptable results; however, the optimal treatment option continues to be debated.

       "  'Mate choice should erode additive genetic variation in sexual displays, yet these traits often harbor substantial genetic variation. Nevertheless, recent developments in quantitative genetics have suggested that multivariate genetic variation in the combinations of traits under selection may still be depleted. Accordingly, the erosion and maintenance of variation may only be detectable by studying whole suites of traits. One potential process favoring the maintenance of genetic variance in multiple trait combinations is the modification of sexual selection via sexually antagonistic interactions between males and females. Here we consider how interlocus sexual conflict can shape the genetic architecture of male sexual traits in the cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. In this species, the ability of each sex to manipulate insemination success significantly alters the selection acting on male courtship call properties. Using a quantitative genetic breeding design we estimated the additive genetic variation in these traits and then predicted the change in variation due to previously documented patterns of sexual selection. Our results indicate that female choice should indeed deplete multivariate genetic variance, but that sexual conflict over insemination success may oppose this loss of variance. We suggest that changes in the direction of selection due to sexually antagonistic interactions will be an important and potentially widespread factor in maintaining multivariate genetic variation.',\n",

       "  'The corticospinal tract (CST) is the main neural pathway responsible for conducting voluntary motor function in the central nervous system. The CST condenses into fiber bundles as it descends from the frontoparietal cortex, traveling down to terminate at the anterior horn of the spinal cord. The CST is at risk of injury from vascular insult from strokes and during neurosurgical procedures. The aim of this article is to identify and describe the vasculature associated with the CST from the cortex to the medulla. Dissection of cadaveric specimens was carried out in a manner, which exposed and preserved the fiber tracts of the CST, as well as the arterial systems that supply them. At the level of the motor cortex, the CST is supplied by terminal branches of the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. The white matter tracts of the corona radiata and internal capsule are supplied by small perforators including the lenticulostriate arteries and branches of the anterior choroidal artery. In the brainstem, the CST is supplied by anterior perforating branches from the basilar and vertebral arteries. The caudal portions of the CST in the medulla are supplied by the anterior spinal artery, which branches from the vertebral arteries. The non‐anastomotic nature of the vessel systems of the CST highlights the importance of their preservation during neurosurgical procedures. Anatomical knowledge of the CST is paramount to clinical diagnosis and treatment of heterogeneity of neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, cerebrovascular, and skull base tumors.',\n",

       "  'Proper protection of vascular access after haemodialysis is one of the key measures for the prevention of catheter-related infections. Various substances with bactericidal and anticoagulant properties are used to fill catheters, but due to the unsatisfactory clinical effects and occurrence of adverse reactions, the search for new substances is still ongoing. In the present paper, we compared the in vitro antimicrobial activity of solutions used for tunnelled catheter locking (taurolidine, trisodium citrate) and solutions of substances that could potentially be used for this purpose (sodium bicarbonate, polyhexanide-betaine). The studies have been conducted on bacteria that most commonly cause catheter-related infections. The values of both minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum biofilm eradication concentration of the substances were determined. The ability of the tested substances to eradicate biofilm from the dialysis catheter surface was also evaluated. The results showed that polyhexanide-betaine inhibited the growth of all microbes comparably to taurolidine, even after ≥ 32-fold dilution. The activity of trisodium citrate and sodium bicarbonate was significantly lower. Polyhexanide exhibited the highest activity in the eradication of bacterial biofilm on polystyrene plates. The biofilm formed on a polyurethane dialysis catheter was resistant to complete eradication by the test substances. Polyhexanide-betaine and taurolidine showed the highest activity. Inhibition of bacterial growth regardless of species was observed not only at the highest concentration of these compounds but also after dilution 32–128x (taurolidine) and 32–1024x (polyhexanide-betaine). Therefore, it can be assumed that taurolidine application as a locking solution prevents catheter colonization and systemic infection development. Taurolidine displays high antimicrobial efficacy against Gram-positive cocci as well as Gram-negative bacilli. On the contrary, the lowest antibacterial effect displayed product contained sodium bicarbonate. The inhibitions of bacterial growth were not satisfactory to consider it as a substance for colonization prevention. Polyhexanidine-betaine possessed potent inhibitory and biofilm eradication properties comparing to all tested products. PHMB is applied as a wound irrigation solution worldwide. However, based on our results, we assume that the PHMB is a promising substance for catheter locking solutions thanks to its safety and high antimicrobial properties.',\n",
       "  'Following the determination of the whole-genome sequence of Corynebacterium glutamicum, we have developed a DNA array to extensively investigate gene expression and regulation relevant to carbon metabolism. For this purpose, a total of 120 C. glutamicum genes, including those in central metabolism and amino acid biosyntheses, were amplified by PCR and printed onto glass slides. The resulting array, designated a “metabolic array”, was used for hybridization with fluorescently labeled cDNA probes generated by reverse transcription from total RNA samples. As the first demonstration of transcriptome analysis in this industrially important microorganism, we applied the metabolic array to study differential transcription profiles between cells grown on glucose and on acetate as the sole carbon source. The changes in gene expression observed for the known acetate-regulated genes (aceA, aceB, pta, and ack) were well consistent with the literature data of northern analyses and enzyme assays, indicating the utility of the metabolic array in transcriptome analysis of C. glutamicum. In addition to the known responses, many previously unrecognized co-regulated genes were identified. For example, several TCA cycle genes, such as gltA, sdhA, sdhB, fumH, and mdh, and the gluconeogenic gene pck were up-regulated in the acetate medium. On the other hand, a few genes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, as well as many amino acid biosynthetic genes, were down-regulated in acetate. Furthermore, two gap genes, gapA and gapB, were found to be inversely regulated, suggesting the presence of a new regulatory step for carbon metabolism between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.',\n",

Unlike MTX, the inhibition of DNA synthesis by IA was time dependent and reached a maximum at 24 h. IA-induced inhibition was due to interference with folate metabolism, since it could be completely reversed with N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate. Competitive transport experiments between IA and either radiolabeled MTX or radiolabeled folate showed that IA preferentially uses the reduced folate/MTX transport system. IA inhibited MTX uptake by 50% at a concentration of 6.8 μM but had a negligible effect on folate transport.',\n",

       "  '1 Filling the urinary bladder via a urethral cannula and preventing its voiding in anaesthetized rats led to rhythmic contractions of the detrusor muscle, which lasted for more than 1 h. This rhythmic activity ceased about 30 min after a s.c. injection of 50 mg kg−1 capsaicin. The contractile response of the detrusor to topically applied capsaicin was lost after systemic administration of the toxin, whereas no change in the sensitivity to acetylcholine was observed. 2 Urinary bladders of normal rats had a capacity of about 1 ml. Bladders of rats treated with capsaicin as neonates held a volume of more than 5 ml without contracting. Such bladders were insensitive to topically applied capsaicin but they contracted to acetylcholine as strongly as the bladders of control rats. 3 During an observation period of 3 days control rats gained weight at night and lost weight by day. Rats treated with capsaicin as neonates showed little fluctuation in body weight. Such rats hardly excreted any urine by day although at night they excreted as much as controls. 4 A water load of 5 ml 100 g−1 was excreted by control rats within 3 h. Rats treated with capsaicin as neonates excreted only half as much. In addition, 50% of the water load was excreted far later by capsaicin treated rats than by controls. Few changes were observed in rats treated with capsaicin as adults. 5 It is concluded that all primary afferent fibres mediating the sensation of a full bladder are capsaicin‐sensitive. An additional effect of capsaicin on renal mechanisms cannot be excluded.',\n",

       "  \"AIM\\nTo assess observer performance in detecting\\xa0endodontic complications using three different cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) units with and without the application of artefact reduction modes.\\n\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY\\nThe study involved 40 freshly extracted human mandibular teeth (n\\xa0=\\xa010 per group) and divided randomly into four endodontic complication groups. Group 1) Instrument fracture; Group 2) Strip perforation; Group 3) Canal underfilling; and Group 4) Canal overfilling. Images of each tooth were obtained using three different CBCT units offering artefact reduction algorithms: the ProMax 3D Max, the Pax Flex 3D and the Dentri S. Four observers evaluated the images for the presence/absence of the four simulated endodontic complications. Weighted kappa coefficients and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to reveal the intra- and inter-observer agreement for each imaging mode, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the observers' performance. DeLong tests were used to compare the results for each image mode and observer using a significance level of α\\xa0=\\xa00.05.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nIn each of the four simulated endodontic complication groups, no significant differences were observed with and without application of artefact reduction for any of the three CBCT units tested. Only two significant differences were detected, and both were between the ProMax 3D Max at low mode AR and ProMax 3D Max without AR: observer 2 in group 1 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0001) and observer 4 in group 4 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.0256).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor each of the three CBCT units tested, application of artefact reduction for detecting endodontic complications is not recommended as a routine tool.\",\n",
       "  'Jean-Martin Charcot has first described multiple sclerosis (MS) as a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) over a century ago. MS remains incurable today, and treatment options are limited to disease modifying drugs. Over the years, significant advances in understanding disease pathology have been made in autoimmune and neurodegenerative components. Despite the fact that brain is the most lipid rich organ in human body, the importance of lipid metabolism has not been extensively studied in this disorder. In MS, the CNS is under attack by a person’s own immune system. Autoantigens and autoantibodies are known to cause devastation of myelin through up regulation of T-cells and cytokines, which penetrate through the blood–brain barrier to cause inflammation and myelin destruction. The anti-inflammatory role of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) has been implicated in a plethora of biological processes: vasodilation, immunity to infection, oxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis. However, it is not known what role HDL plays in neurological function and myelin repair in MS. Understanding of lipid metabolism in the CNS and in the periphery might unveil new therapeutic targets and explain the partial success of some existing MS therapies.',\n",
       "  'Transcription-targeted gene delivery directed against angiogenic endothelial cells is a new approach against advanced cancer. Moreover, the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene coupled with low dose radiotherapy is an efficient and externally controlled cytotoxic system. We have previously demonstrated enhanced endothelial-specific cell expression and killing using the modified murine pre-proendothelin-1 promoter (PPE1-3x) to direct adenoviral expression of a pro-apoptotic gene. The purpose of this study was to create an externally potentiated systemic antiangiogenic gene delivery system based on an adenoviral vector expressing HSV-TK under the regulation of PPE1-3X promoter combined with radiotherapy for eradicating metastatic cancer. Ad-PPE1-3x-TK induced endothelial-specific cell killing in-vitro upon introduction of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV). BALB/c mice bearing a primary CT-26 colon carcinoma tumor showed tumor growth suppression and diminished tumor angiogenesis when the vector was administered intravenously, activated with GCV and potentiated with a single sub-therapeutic and non-toxic radiation dose. Moreover, intravenous administration of the vector, activated with GCV and potentiated with chest aimed radiation, to C57BL/6 mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma metastases resulted in prolongation of mice survival. PPE1-3x-regulated HSV-TK expression was detected only in lung metastases in contrast to CMV-regulated expression. This novel system may benefit patients with metastatic disease.',\n",

Such data assess the quality of control programmes and help forecast future trends of drug resistance. It will also help to establish guidelines for TB therapy. The aim of the current study was to describe the rate of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the Sunamganj District of Bangladesh. Bacterial isolates were collected from sputum smear positive (ss+) patients who attended the National TB Programme from November 2003 to December 2004. A total of 95 isolates was tested for susceptibility to streptomycin (SM), isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RMP) and ethambutol (EMB) at the National Reference Laboratory for Mycobacteria at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), Oslo. The total resistance among new cases to any drug was 31%. For SM it was 18%, INH 23%, RMP 2%, EMB 10% and 2% were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) in Sunamganj is still effective, although the high resistance to INH is alarming. An increased risk of treatment failure has been demonstrated in areas with high levels of INH resistance, and a high proportion of INH resistant cases may develop resistance to RMP during treatment.',\n",

(2) Test if the Functional Comorbidity Index is more strongly associated (a better predictor) than the well-known Charlson Comorbidity Index (range, 0-37) with these SF-36 outcome measures. Study Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University of Washington Sleep Center. Subjects and Methods In a cohort of newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea patients (N = 233), we obtained scores for the Functional Comorbidity Index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and SF-36. We calculated Spearman correlations and adjusted coefficients of determination (R2) with multiple linear regression, adjusted for demographic and health covariates. Bootstrapping generated R2 distributions for statistical comparison. Results Functional Comorbidity Index scores (mean ± standard deviation 2.4 ± 1.7) were more widely distributed than Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (0.7 ± 1.4). The Functional Comorbidity Index was significantly correlated with SF-36 Physical Function (–0.53, P < .001), Physical Component Score (–0.44, P < .001), and Mental Component Score (–0.38, P < .001). The Functional Comorbidity Index was a better predictor than the Charlson Comorbidity Index of SF-36 Physical Function (R2 mean ± standard error 0.27 ± 0.05 vs 0.17 ± 0.05, P < .001), Physical Component Score (0.23 ± 0.05 vs 0.17 ± 0.05, P < .001), and Mental Component Score (0.23 ± 0.05 vs 0.13 ± 0.05, P < .001).

Competitive tennis players, 191 males and 174 females, completed the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated statistically significant differences in MT based on age as well as length of tennis participation, but not as a function of the players’ ethnicity, sex, and competitive standard. Older age groups and athletes participating for longer periods of time tended to report higher levels of total MT, constancy, and control compared to the younger and less experienced age groups. Age and length of participation group differences between the older age (30–48 years and 49 years and older) and longer period of participation (16–25 years, 26–35 years, and 36 or more years) categories were not found for total MT, constancy, and control. The implications for the nature and development of MT in competitive tennis are discussed, with the need to consider personal and sport involvement characteristics, among other factors, when designing MT interventions that are appropriate for individual tennis players.',\n",
       "  'RGS proteins finely tune heterotrimeric G‐protein signaling. Implying the need for such fine‐tuning in the developing vascular system, in situ hybridization revealed a striking and extensive expression pattern of Rgs5 in the arterial walls of E12.5–E17.5 mouse embryos. The distribution and location of the Rgs5‐positive cells typified that of pericytes and strikingly overlapped the known expression pattern of platelet‐derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)‐β. Both E14.5 PDGFR‐β‐ and platelet‐derived growth factor (PDGF)‐B‐deficient mice exhibited markedly reduced levels of Rgs5 in their vascular plexa and small arteries. This likely reflects the loss of pericytes in the mutant mice. RGS5 acts as a potent GTPase activating protein for Giα and Gqα and it attenuated angiotensin II‐, endothelin‐1‐, sphingosine‐1‐phosphate‐, and PDGF‐induced ERK‐2 phosphorylation. Together these results indicate that RGS5 exerts control over PDGFR‐β and GPCR‐mediated signaling pathways active during fetal vascular maturation.',\n",

Colistin-based regimen is the recommended treatment. Which drugs should be combined with colistin remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with XDRAB pneumonia who were treated with colistin, combined with either 6-g sulbactam or carbapenems, in the setting of high MIC to sulbactam. Patients and methods In this prospective cohort study, hospitalized patients diagnosed with XDRAB pneumonia in Phramongkutklao Hospital were enrolled. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 7- and 14-day mortality, length of stay, ventilator days and factors associated with mortality. Results From 1 July 2016 to 30 September 2017, 182 patients were included; 92 received colistin plus sulbactam and 90 received colistin plus carbapenems. Most of the patients were males diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia in medical intensive care unit. Overall mortality rates at 7, 14, 28 days were 24.2%, 37.4%, and 53.3%, respectively. Mortality rates did not differ between sulbactam group and carbapenem groups at 7 days (19.6% vs 28.9%, p-value 0.424, adjusted HR 1.277; 95% CI = 0.702–2.322), 14 days (34.8% vs 40%, p = 0.658, adjusted HR 1.109; 95% CI = 0.703–1.749) and 28 days (51.1% vs 55.6%, p = 0.857, adjusted HR 1.038; 95% CI = 0.690–1.562). Length of stay, ICU days and ventilator days did not differ. Complications of treatment including acute kidney injury were not statistically different. Conclusion In XDRAB pneumonia with high MIC to sulbactam, differences in mortality rates were not statistically significant between colistin plus 6-g sulbactam and colistin plus carbapenems.',\n",

       "  '&NA; Severe hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) has been present in layers in the northeast of China since June 2015, with mortality rates varying from 30 to 90%. Dead layers had severe hydropericardium with pericardial volumes of 5 to 20 mL, as well as inclusion body hepatitis. Laboratory investigations led to the isolation of a fowl adenovirus strain, HLJFAd15, from the liver tissue of dead layers. Natural deletions of ORF19 and ORF27 were found in this clinical strain by complete genome sequencing, which was identified with the novel genotype recently prevalent in China. The pathogenicity characterization was conducted in 35‐day‐old SPF chickens using HLJFAd15 with novel genotype of fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV‐4). The reproduction disease cases of HPS with mortality rates of 76.9% by oral administration and 100% by intramuscular injection were induced successfully by challenging SPF chickens, respectively. Non‐enveloped viral particles with a mean diameter of approximately 80 nm were found in the livers of virus‐infected SPF chickens. Our study revealed that HLJFAd15 was identified with the novel genotype strains recently emerging in China by complete genome sequencing, and the strain was capable of causing HPS by the pathogenicity analysis. However, although there is currently no commercial vaccine against the novel genotype FAdV‐4, the animal infection model established in this study was valuable for vaccine evaluation and development.',\n",
       "  'Porous boron nitride (BN) is structurally analogous to activated carbon. This material is gaining increasing attention for its potential in a range of adsorption and chemical separation applications, with a number of recent proof-of-concept studies on the removal of organics from water. Today though, the properties of porous BN—i.e., surface area, pore network, chemistry—that dictate adsorption of specific organics remain vastly unknown. Yet, they will need to be optimized to realize the full potential of the material in the envisioned applications. Here, a selection of porous BN materials with varied pore structures and chemistries were studied for the adsorption of different organic molecules, either directly, through vapor sorption analyses or as part of a water/organic mixture in the liquid phase. These separations are relevant to the industrial and environmental sectors and are envisioned to take advantage of the hydrophobic character of the BN sheets. The materials were tested and regenerated and their physical and chemical features were characterized before and after testing. This study allowed identifying the adsorption mechanisms, assessing the performance of porous BN compared to benchmarks in the field and outlining ways to improve the adsorption performance further.',\n",

       "  'During baseline evaluation prior to a preclinical safety study, a 10-month-old male pure-bred Beagle dog was found to have marked thrombocytopenia (6 × 103 platelets [PLT]/µL) associated with a mean platelet volume (MPV) of 17.9 fL. Tests for Rickettsia rickettsii, Ehrlichia canis, and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative. Buccal bleeding time was normal. Over 3 months, PLT were 4 to 141 × 103 PLT/µL, and MPV was 11.4 to 25.1 fL; however, PLT were <50 × 103 PLT/µL and MPV was >16 fL during most of this period. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-PLT antibody tests were negative. Genotyping for the presence of a beta 1-tubulin mutation demonstrated the normal wild-type gene. Treatment with prednisone resulted in normal values after only 3 days. Ultrastructure of enlarged PLT was consistent with that of immature PLT, characterized by reduced numbers of peripheral microtubules and the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, and a prominent canalicular system. PLT ultrastructure and glucocorticoid responsiveness supported a diagnosis of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that was masked by the cyclic nature of PLT decreases and lack of clinical signs. Inclusion of such a dog in a preclinical safety study could result in misinterpretation of clinical pathology findings.',\n",
       "  'Background Assessment of coronary endothelial function with intracoronary acetylcholine (IC-Ach) provides diagnostic and prognostic data in patients with suspected coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), but is often not feasible due in part to the time and expertise needed for pharmacologic mixing. Cold pressor testing (CPT) is a simple and safe stimulus useful for either invasive or non-invasive endothelial function testing and myocardial perfusion imaging but has not been specifically evaluated among symptomatic women with signs of ischemic heart disease (IHD) who have no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods 163 women with signs and symptoms of IHD and no obstructive CAD from the NHLBI- Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation-Coronary Vascular Dysfunction (WISE-CVD) study underwent coronary reactivity testing with a Doppler flow wire (FloWire® Volcano, San Diego, CA) in the proximal left anterior descending artery. Coronary artery diameter and coronary blood flow (CBF) assessed by core lab using QCA before and after IC-Ach (18.2 μg/ml infused over 3 minutes) and during CPT. Results Mean age was 55 ± 12 years. Rate pressure product (RPP) in response to IC-Ach did not change (baseline to peak, P = 0.26), but increased during CPT (363±1457; P = 0.0028). CBF in response to CPT was poorly correlated to IC-Ach CBF. Change in coronary artery diameter after IC-Ach correlated with change after CPT (r = 0.59, P<0.001). The correlation coefficient was stronger in subjects with coronary dilation to IC-Ach (r = 0.628, P<0.001) versus those without dilation (r = 0.353, P = 0.002), suggesting that other factors may be important to this relationship when endothelium is abnormal. Conclusions In women with no obstructive CAD and suspected CMD, coronary diameter changes with IC-Ach and CPT are moderately-well correlated suggesting that CPT testing may be of some use, particularly among patients with normal endothelial function, however, not an alternative to IC-Ach for diagnosis of coronary endothelial dysfunction.',\n",
       "  'Prostate cancer (PC) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by variable morphological patterns. Thus, establishing a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model that retains the key features of the primary tumor for each type of PC is important for appropriate evaluation. In this study, we established PDX models of hormone-naïve (D17225) and castration-resistant (B45354) PC by implanting fresh tumor samples, obtained from patients with advanced PC under the renal capsule of immune-compromised mice. Supplementation with exogenous androgens shortened the latent period of tumorigenesis and increased the tumor formation rate. The PDX models exhibited the same major genomic and phenotypic features of the disease in humans and maintained the main pathological features of the primary tumors. Moreover, both PDX models showed different outcomes after castration or docetaxel treatment. The hormone-naïve D17225 PDX model displayed a range of responses from complete tumor regression to overt tumor progression, and the development of castrate-resistant PC was induced after castration. The responses of the two PDX models to androgen deprivation and docetaxel were similar to those observed in patients with advanced PC. These new preclinical PC models will facilitate research on the mechanisms underlying treatment response and resistance.',\n",
       "  'ABSTRACT Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related species are considered to be typical endosomal pathogens, recent studies have suggested that mycobacteria can be present in the cytoplasm of infected cells and cause cytoskeleton rearrangements, the mechanisms of which remain unknown. Here, we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to demonstrate that the heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), a surface adhesin from Mycobacterium tuberculosis displaying sequence similarities with actin-binding proteins, is able to bind to actin. Force curves recorded between actin and the coiled-coil, N-terminal domain of HBHA showed a bimodal distribution of binding forces reflecting the detection of single and double HBHA-actin interactions. Force curves obtained between actin and the lysine-rich C-terminal domain of HBHA showed a broader distribution of binding events, suggesting they originate primarily from intermolecular electrostatic bridges between cationic HBHA domains and anionic actin residues. We also explored the dynamics of the HBHA-actin interaction, showing that the binding force and binding frequency increased with the pulling speed and contact time, respectively. Taken together, our data indicate that HBHA is able to specifically bind actin, via both its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, strongly suggesting a role of the HBHA-actin interaction in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial diseases.',\n",
       "  'Nuclear inclusion bodies typical of the adenovirus group were widespread in the spleen and other tissues of 8-week-old turkeys with severe respiratory disease and concomitant evidence of colisepticemia. Adenoviral virions were seen in affected nuclei of splenic tissue and in negatively stained preparations of ground spleen. In splenic tissue, inclusions were most prominent in reticular cells and macrophages in the periarterial lymphoid sheaths, the red pulp and the marginal zones of the periarteriolar reticular sheaths. Marked reticuloendothelial hyperplasia, lymphoid atrophy and granulocytic splenitis characterized the splenic changes. There were inclusions in the respiratory tract, intestinal tract, liver, kidney and pancreas.

The aim of this study was to assess DNA integrity and chromatin condensation in the spermatozoa of men with cancer before and after treatment. Chromatin condensation was evaluated using flowcytometric assessment with propidium iodide, DNA integrity was determined using the comet assay. Thirty‐three men with cancer (testicular cancer, lymphoma and leukaemia) and 14 men with proven fertility took part in the study. The study found that in men with cancer, the percentage of spermatozoa with highly condensed DNA was less than that of controls. DNA integrity when assessed using the comet assay was also reduced by cancer. Percentage head DNA intact and percentage of condensed chromatin in the spermatozoa of men with cancer after treatment were less than those in fertile men. This study, although small, does demonstrate a detrimental effect on chromatin condensation and DNA integrity of cancer and its treatment. These findings are important because of the potential effects impaired chromatin and DNA integrity could have on fertilization, blastocyst and embryo development.',\n",

       "  'Empirical evidence suggests that prolonged underfeeding of protein to late-pregnant dry cows can have modest negative carry-over effects on milk volume and/or protein yield during early lactation, and may also cause increased incidence of metabolic diseases associated with fatty liver. However, assessment of requirements is hampered by lack of information on relationships between dietary intake of crude protein (N × 6·25) and metabolizable protein supply during late pregnancy, and by incomplete understanding of the quantitative metabolism of amino acids in maternal and conceptus tissues. Inability of the postparturient cow to consume sufficient protein to meet mammary and extra-mammary amino acid requirements, including a significant demand for hepatic gluconeogenesis, necessitates a substantial, albeit transient, mobilization of tissue protein during the first 2 weeks of lactation. Ultimately, much of this mobilized protein appears to be derived from peripheral tissues, especially skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, skin, through suppression of tissue protein synthesis, and possibly increased proteolysis. In the shorter term, soon after calving, it is likely that amino acids required for hepatic glucose synthesis are diverted from high rates of synthesis of splanchnic tissue and export proteins, including serum albumin. The prevailing endocrine milieu of the periparturient cow, including major reductions in plasma levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I, together with insulin resistance in peripheral tissues, must permissively facilitate, if not actively promote, net mobilization of amino acids from these tissues.',\n",
       "  'Aspergillus fumigatus is an environmental filamentous fungus that also acts as an opportunistic pathogen able to cause a variety of symptoms, from an allergic response to a life-threatening disseminated fungal infection. The infectious agents are inhaled conidia whose first point of contact is most likely to be an airway epithelial cell (AEC). The interaction between epithelial cells and conidia is multifaceted and complex, and has implications for later steps in pathogenesis. Increasing evidence has demonstrated a key role for the airway epithelium in the response to respiratory pathogens, particularly at early stages of infection; therefore, elucidating the early stages of interaction of conidia with AECs is essential to understand the establishment of infection in cohorts of at-risk patients. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the early interactions between A. fumigatus and AECs, including bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. We describe mechanisms of adhesion, internalization of conidia by AECs, the immune response of AECs, as well as the role of fungal virulence factors, and patterns of fungal gene expression characteristic of early infection. A clear understanding of the mechanisms involved in the early establishment of infection by A. fumigatus could point to novel targets for therapy and prophylaxis.',\n",
       "  'Objectives: The ABSORB cohort A trial using the bioresorbable everolimus‐eluting scaffold (BVS revision 1.0, Abbott Vascular) demonstrated a slightly higher acute recoil with BVS than with metallic stents. To reinforce the mechanical strength of the scaffold, the new BVS scaffold (revision 1.1) with modified strut design was developed and tested in the ABSORB cohort B trial. This study sought to evaluate and compare the in vivo acute scaffold recoil of the BVS revision 1.0 in ABSORB cohort A and the BVS revision 1.1 in ABSORB cohort B with the historical recoil of the XIENCE V® everolimus‐eluting metal stent (EES, SPIRIT I and II). Methods: In the ABSORB cohort B trial, 101 patients with one or two de‐novo lesions were enrolled at 10 sites. In ABSORB cohort A, 27 patients treated with a BVS 1.0 were analyzed and compared with EES. Acute absolute recoil, assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, was defined as the difference between mean diameter of the last inflated balloon at the highest pressure (X) and mean lumen diameter of the stent immediately after the last balloon deflation (Y). Acute percent recoil was defined as (X ‐ Y)/X and expressed as a percentage. Results: Out of 101 patients enrolled in the ABSORB cohort B trial, 88 patients are available for complete analysis of acute recoil. Absolute recoil of BVS 1.1 (0.19 ± 0.18 mm) was numerically higher than metallic EES (vs. 0.13 ± 0.21 mm) and similar to BVS 1.0 (0.20 ± 0.21 mm) but the differences did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.40). The acute percent recoil demonstrated the same trend (EES: 4.3% ± 7.1%, BVS 1.0: 6.9% ± 7.0%, BVS 1.1: 6.7% ± 6.4%, P = 0.22). In the multivariate regression model, high balloon/artery ratio (>1.1) (OR 1.91 [1.34–2.71]) was the predictive for high absolute recoil (>0.27 mm) while (larger) preprocedural MLD was protective (OR 0.84 [0.72–0.99]). The stent/scaffold type was not a predictor of acute recoil. Conclusions: The average in vivo acute scaffold recoil of the BVS 1.1 is slightly higher than the metallic EES. However, the scaffold/stent type was not predictive of high acute recoil, while implantation in undersized vessels or usage of oversized devices might confound the results. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.',\n",
       "  'Objective: To investigate antibacterial effects of extracts from the seaweed Chondrococcus hornemanni (C. hornemanni) on bacterial pathogens of marine ornamental fish. Method: Methanol extract obtained from C. hornemanni showed a broad and high antibacterial activity against four fish pathogens including Providencia rettgeri, Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio alginoticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The crude extract obtained from the dried seaweeds was fractionated and purified using column chromatography. Purified extracts were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for identifying the functional groups. Phytoconstituents of the active fraction were further identified by means of gas chromatography and mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis. Result: The first fraction of the extracts showed effective inhibitory activity against Aeromonas hydrophila and Vibrio parahaemolyticus at a concentration of 100 µL. However, Vibrio alginolyticus and Providencia rettgeri had shown a moderately lesser inhibitory response to the extract. Conclusion: Hence, it is concluded that extracts of seaweed C. hornemanni, contain potential bioactive compounds with a considerable antibiotic activity.',\n",
       "  'Attachment with parents is central to a child’s development. It is well established that the quality of this attachment in early childhood is a strong predictor of developmental and psychological functioning throughout the life span. One of the primary issues in custody evaluations is assessing the quality of the child’s attachment to each parent and the parents’ capacity to foster security and to consider what this might mean for short- and medium-term decisions about their care. The nature of attachment measures is summarized, and the combined use of three attachment-caregiving instruments in a custody evaluation is illustrated through the case of a toddler whose parents were engaged in a high-conflict divorce. The case study demonstrates how, in addition to standard clinical observations, including a set of attachment-based instruments with a standardized psychological test battery provided information critical to a recommendation for custody and parent visitation.',\n",
       "  'During the past decade, research on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has increased substantially. As the quantity and quality of research have improved, a more optimistic perspective of the disorder has begun to emerge. To address this issue, this paper summarises the characteristics and related attentional problems of children with disorders of attention. Attentional processes in theories of observational learning are discussed and the link between observational learning and social skills training are addressed. The literature review also suggests current intervention strategies, and promising avenues for future research.',\n",
       "  'The interaction of a hydroxyl OH radical with a graphene surface has been investigated by the density functional theory (DFT) method in order to elucidate the radical scavenge mechanism of the graphene surface. The DFT calculation showed that the OH radical binds directly to the carbon atom of the graphene surface and a strong C–O bond is formed. The binding energies were dependent on the cluster size and were distributed in the 4.1–9.5 kcal/mol range at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The potential energy curve plotted as a function of the distance of OH from the surface carbon showed that the OH radical can bind to the carbon atom with a low activation barrier: the barrier heights for n = 7 and 14 were calculated to be 3.9 and 1.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Also, it was found that the structural change from sp2 to sp3-like hybridization occurs by the approach of the OH radical.',\n",
       "  'This study explored the uptake of homebirth by healthy pregnant women from the perspective of community midwives (CMs). This paper presents factors that CMs expressed contributed to and/or detracted from their job satisfaction. Interviews were conducted with four practising CMs who were employed by a large acute NHS Trust in England providing a non-continuity model of care. Data were analysed thematically and are presented in two categories: (1) continuity of care and (2) working relationships and workloads. Findings suggest that if maternity service providers attended to factors that enhanced the job satisfaction of CMs inclined to support homebirth, this may contribute to increasing its uptake by pregnant women.',\n",
       "  'Background Intellectual disability (ID) is a highly heterogeneous condition affecting 2% of the population worldwide. In a field study conducted in a highly inbred area of Northeastern Brazil, we investigated a consanguineous family in which seven adults presented syndromic ID. Methods Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix) microarray was used to determine regions of homozygosity-by-descent and whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in one affected individual using Extended Nextera Rapid-Capture Exome and Illumina HiSeq2500. Results We found two regions with an logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.234: a region spanning 4.0 Mb in 19q13.32-q13.33 and a pericentromeric 20 Mb area in chromosome 2 (2p12-q11.2). WES disclosed in the critical region of chromosome 19 a homozygous variant (c.418C>T, p.Arg140Trp) in Mediator complex subunit 25 (MED25), predicted as deleterious by PolyPhen-2, Provean, Mutation Taster and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT). MED25 is a component of the Mediator complex, involved in regulation of transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Deleterious mutations in MED12, MED17 and MED23 have already been associated with ID. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that the combination of field investigation of families in highly inbred regions with modern technologies is an effective way for identifying new genes associated with ID.',\n",
       "  \"Healthcare systems are facing the challenge of information overload in caring for patients in a safe, affordable and high quality manner in a system with limited healthcare resources . To alleviate this problem, we develop a cloud-based patient profile analytics system for monitoring diabetes patient's data. Data analytics is nothing but drawing the conclusion about that information by examining the raw data. This healthcare system extracts the data from various sources and stores the information in a patient profile graph. The data consist of both structured and unstructured data. The patient profile graph provides a holistic view of the patient's information. The system can infer implicit information useful for clinical purposes and administration and also extracting the relevant information for performing predictive analytics. The predictive analysis can predict the risk of unplanned patient readmission and also the chances of getting the diabetes based on dietary plans and family history.\",\n",
       "  'Fungus gnats, Bradysia spp. (Diptera: Sciaridae), are major insect pests because the larvae can directly damage plants grown in greenhouse production systems. In general, insecticides are commonly used to suppress fungus gnat larval populations. However, the rove beetle, Dalotia coriaria (Kraatz) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), a commercially available predator of insect pests, including fungus gnat larvae, may be an alternative to using insecticides. Growing medium selection used for growing plants can influence insect pest and predator interactions in greenhouse production systems; however, quantitative information is limited. Therefore, we conducted greenhouse experiments and a laboratory experiment to determine the effects of growing medium type on D. coriaria adult predation and fungus gnat, Bradysia. sp. nr. coprophila (Lintner) (Diptera: Sciaridae), larval survival when feeding on the roots of coleus, Solenostemon scutellarioides (L.) Codd, plants. In addition, experiments were conducted to determine the number of rove beetle adults, based on predator:prey ratios, needed to regulate fungus gnat larval populations. In all three experiments, fewer fungus gnat larvae survived in Pro-Mix BX than the Berger BM1 growing medium, and rove beetles reduced the number of fungus gnat larvae in both growing media in the greenhouse experiments. Although predator:prey ratio was not significant, we found that 10 rove beetle adults per 15.2-cm diameter container (1834.82 cm3 with 2.0 L of growing medium) regulated fungus gnat larval populations at the densities investigated. Therefore, greenhouse producers should consider the effects of production practices, such as growing medium type, when using rove beetles to regulate fungus gnat larval populations.',\n",
       "  'This article sets out to describe some of the content of a recent Ph.D. thesis (Birmingham University) entitled ‘Music in the Pastoral Care of Emotionally Disturbed Children’. The thesis attempts to articulate an understanding at theoretical and practical levels of what it is in the process of music in the pastoral care of emotionally disturbed children that brings about a degree of transformation in the client. The theory gradually evolved through the practice of music therapy with emotionally disturbed children in a residential school over a two-year period. Three case studies are described in the thesis: one of these is included in this article. The particular contribution of this thesis is that it suggests and describes a direct link between the elemental dynamics of music and the elemental dynamics of people in relationship in the context of creative musical play. This play is then considered as a medium in which transformation of damaged people in relationship may occur.',\n",
       "  'Abstract The genus Cremifania Czerny combines characters of various taxa which Hennig (1958) placed in two superfamilies, the Sciomyzoidea and the Lauxanioidea. In some ways it can be considered a taxonomic link between the two groups. Important characters of the genus are compared with homologous characters in related families and its taxonomic relationships are discussed. At the same time, a family tree for the major families assigned to both superfamilies is suggested. Cremifania does not fit well in any family as they are now defined, but, because it fits best in the Chamaemyiidae, that family is redefined to embrace the genus. The family is then divided into two subfamilies, the Cremifaniinae, new subfamily, for Cremifania, and the Chamaemyiinae comprised of two tribes, the Chamaemyiini and Leucopini, new tribe; a key to all the suprageneric categories is presented. A new Cremifania, the second known species of the genus and the first Nearctic one, is described from New Mexico.',\n",

       "  \"BACKGROUND\\nMethylprednisolone (MP) acetate is a commonly used corticosteroid for suppression of inflammation in synovial structures in horses. Its use is often regulated in equine sports by plasma MP concentrations.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVES\\nTo describe variability in MP plasma concentrations after MP acetate injection in different synovial structures and with co-administration with hyaluronic acid (HA).\\n\\n\\nSTUDY DESIGN\\nField study in actively racing horses in three disciplines (Thoroughbred, Standardbred and Quarter Horse).\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nSeventy-six horses (15 Thoroughbreds, 20 Standardbreds and 41 Quarter Horses) were included in the study. Injection of any synovial structure with a total body dose of 100 mg MP acetate was permitted, data were grouped according to the synovial structure injected and co-administration with HA. Plasma was collected before injection and at 6 days post-injection. Per cent censored data (below the limit of quantification) for each synovial structure were determined, and summary statistics generated by Robust Regression on Order. Differences between synovial structures and co-administration with HA were identified by ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc testing.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe MP plasma concentration at 6 days for injection for the entire group (mean ± standard deviation [s.d.], pg/mL) was 96 ± 104. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) plasma concentrations contained 86% censored data and could not be included in the statistical analysis. The carpal joints (CJO) group had a lower plasma MP concentration (P<0.05) than the distal tarsal joints (DTJ) or medial femorotibial (MFT), the no HA (NHA) group had a lower plasma MP concentration (P<0.05) than HA.\\n\\n\\nMAIN LIMITATIONS\\nThe synovial structures injected varied by racing discipline, so this study was unable to identify any differences between disciplines.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nPractitioners should be aware that injection of DTJ, CS and MFT joints, and combining MP acetate with HA may prolong its clearance, and withdrawal times for competition in regulated equine sports.\",\n",

       "  'Abstract:Cytokeratins are a major component of colloid bodies that are essentially diagnostic of lichen planopilaris (LPP). Here, the authors assess the ability of the cytokeratin 903 antibody (CK-903) to stain colloid bodies and differentiate LPP from other histologically similar appearing primary cicatricial alopecias. A retrospective review of all specimens submitted to the dermatopathology department over a 2-year window identified 18 cases of LPP and 20 cases of histologically similar appearing entities (discoid lupus erythematosus or central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia) through a combination of H&E, elastic van gieson, and periodic acid-schiff stains. All 38 samples were then prospectively stained with CK-903. Colloid bodies were identifiable in 3 of the 18 LPP cases based on H&E alone but were seen in 9 of 18 cases when CK-903 was used. There were no cases where colloid bodies were seen on H&E but not subsequently identified with CK-903. Additionally, there was no CK-903 staining in any of the 20 cases of similar appearing entities except 1 case of discoid lupus erythematosus, which is known to occasionally show colloid bodies. The authors conclude that CK-903 is a useful adjunctive tool that will allow for a quicker, less costly, and more accurate diagnosis of LPP given its ability identify colloid bodies even in the setting of significant inflammation and fibrosis and its advantages over direct immunofluorescence of low cost, short preparation time, and lack of need for a specialized fluorescent microscope.',\n",
       "  'Abstract Nasal congestion is considered the most bothersome of allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms and can significantly impair ability to function at work, home, and school. Effective management of AR-related nasal congestion depends on accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Many individuals with AR and AR-related congestion remain undiagnosed and do not receive prescription medication. However, new tools intended to improve the diagnosis of nasal congestion have been developed and validated. Intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) are recommended as first-line therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe AR and also when nasal congestion is a prominent symptom. Double-blind, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated greater efficacy of INSs versus placebo, antihistamines, or montelukast for relief of all nasal symptoms, especially congestion. Patient adherence to treatment also affects outcomes, and this may be influenced by patient preferences for the sensory attributes of an individual drug. Increased awareness of the effects of AR-related nasal congestion, the efficacy and safety of available pharmacotherapies, and barriers to adherence may improve clinical outcomes.',\n",
       "  'ABSTRACT This study proposes a biological nitrogen removal system for freshwater aquaria consisting of a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) and an up-flow sludge blanket (USB). DHS–USB systems can perform nitrification and denitrification simultaneously, reducing ammonia (NH3) and nitrate (NO3−) toxicity in the water. The performance of the system was evaluated using on-site fresh water aquaria at ambient temperature (23–34°C) over 192 days. NH3 and nitrite (NO2−) were maintained at a detection limit of 0.01\\u2005mg\\u2005N\\u2005L−1 and NO3− was maintained below 10\\u2005mg\\u2005N\\u2005L−1, despite limited water exchange. The 16S rRNA gene of microorganisms from the sludge retained in the bioreactors was sequenced to identify the microbial communities present. Microbial community analysis revealed that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), Ca. Nitrososphaera and Nitrosopumilus, played an important role in nitrification in the DHS reactor, while denitrifying bacteria Thauera played an important role in denitrification in the USB reactor. The proposed DHS–USB system is a promising technological advancement in the development of lower maintenance aquaria.',\n",
       "  \"Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text Objective: Describe the relationship between the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) with balance performance, as well as fall status in patients with peripheral vestibular disorders. Study Design: Retrospective. Setting: Outpatient balance clinic, tertiary referral center. Patients: Data from 97 patients (age: 54.8\\u200a±\\u200a12.3 yrs; 48 women) with dizziness or imbalance symptoms of peripheral vestibular origin were used for analysis. Intervention(s): / Main Outcome Measure(s): ABC-scores, DHI-scores, static and dynamic balance tests, and fall status of the past 4\\u200aweeks, 2\\u200amonths, and 6\\u200amonths before the time of measurement were collected. Spearman's rho correlations, χ2 with post-hoc testing, and Kruskal–Wallis with post-hoc Mann–Whitney U test results were interpreted. Results: The ABC- and DHI-scores show moderate correlations with static balance (ABC: r\\u200a=\\u200a0.44; DHI: r\\u200a=\\u200a–0.34) and dynamic balance tests (ABC: r\\u200a=\\u200a[–0.47;0.56]; DHI: r\\u200a=\\u200a[–0.48;0.39]) and a strong inverse correlation with each other (ABC: 70\\u200a±\\u200a25; DHI: 33\\u200a±\\u200a26; r\\u200a=\\u200a–0.84). Related to fall status, weak correlations were found (ABC: r\\u200a=\\u200a[–0.29;–0.21]; DHI: r\\u200a=\\u200a[0.29;0.33]). Additional results show that subjects in the low-level functioning (ABC) or severe self-perceived disability (DHI) categories have a poorer balance assessed by standing balance, Timed-Up-and-Go and Functional Gait Assessment and are more likely to have experienced multiple falls. Conclusions: The ABC-scale and DHI showed a strong convergent validity, additionally the ABC-scale showed a better concurrent validity with balance performances and the DHI with fall history. In general, patients with peripheral vestibular impairments reporting a lower self-confidence or a more severe self-perceived disability show worse balance performances and a higher fall incidence.\",\n",
