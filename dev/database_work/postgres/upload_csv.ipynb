Recent genetic analyses have revealed gain-of-function STAT3 mutations in lymphoid cancers leading to hyperactivation of STAT3, which may represent a potential therapeutic target. Using a functional reporter assay, we screened 306 compounds with selective activity against various target molecules to identify drugs capable of inhibiting the cellular activity of STAT3. Top hits were further validated with additional models including STAT3-mutated natural killer (NK)-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia cells to assess their ability to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 dependent cell viability. We identified JAK, mTOR, Hsp90 and CDK inhibitors as potent inhibitors of both WT and mutant STAT3 activity. The Hsp90 inhibitor luminespib was highly effective at reducing the viability of mutant STAT3 NK cell lines and LGL leukemia patient samples. Luminespib decreased the phosphorylation of mutant STAT3 at Y705, whereas JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib had reduced efficacy on mutant STAT3 phosphorylation. Additionally, combinations involving Hsp90, JAK and mTOR inhibitors were more effective at reducing cell viability than single agents. Our findings show alternative approaches to inhibit STAT3 activity and suggest Hsp90 as a therapeutic target in lymphoproliferative disorders with constitutively active STAT3.\"\\n',\n",

Undergraduate men (n ¼232) completed similarity-ratings and recognition-memory tasks with photos of undergraduate women who varied in attractiveness, provocativeness of clothing and expression of sexual interest. Participants also completed a control memory task and a measure relevant to the risk of exhibiting sexually aggressive behaviour, as well as indicating how many serious relationships they had experienced. Multilevel regression techniques revealed that (a) men’s memory for women’s sexual interest improved when women were sexually interested at encoding, attractive and dressed provocatively; (b) men who reported more frequent serious relationships showed better memory for women’s sexual interest and (c) men at risk of exhibiting sexually aggressive behaviour showed worse memory for women’s sexual interest. Copyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Men’s memory for women’s heterosocially relevant affect (e.g. sexual interest and rejection) is a surprisingly understudied area of inquiry, given the hypothesized centrality of affective processing to social interactions, intimate relationships and sexual aggression among acquaintances (e.g. Abbey, McAuslan, & Ross, 1998; Casey, Garrett, Brackett, & Rivers, 2007; Mayer, Roberts, & Barsade, 2008; McFall, 1990). Nonverbal affective cues, particularly sexual-interest and rejection cues, frequently are used to communicate to a current or potential partner the likelihood that initial or continued sexual overtures will be received positively (e.g. Abbey, 1982; Fichten, Tagalakis, Judd, Wright, & Amsel, 1992; Muehlenhard, Koralewski, Andrews, & Burdick, 1986). Heterosocial competence requires not only accurate perception of these affective cues, however, but also recognition of changes in the cues, such as from positive to negative. Memory provides critical support for successful change detection, via adequate storage and retrieval of affective information. Successful initiation and maintenance of serious romantic relationships, for example, necessitate detection and retention of the fluctuations in a partner’s emotions. Moreover, decreased attention and sensitivity to young women’s affective cues have been linked to an increased risk of sexually coercive or aggressive behaviour towards acquaintances among college-aged males (see review by Farris, Treat, Viken, & McFall, 2008). Above and beyond impoverished encoding of women’s affect, however, insufficient storage or retrieval of women’s affective cues may decrease the likelihood that high-risk men recognize and respond appropriately to women’s changing affect. In sum, careful characterization of the correlates of memory for young women’s sexual interest may advance our understanding of the role of affective processing in both normative and problematic heterosocial interactions. The present work uses multilevel modelling techniques to distinguish two classes of influences on men’s memory:\"\\n',\n",
       " '3,,d4c9b2fa2b760b5cf90ce8635a7dede5b4cd58a2,73484844,\"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate the synaptic and metabolic actions of glutamate. These iGluRs are classified within the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-type, kainate-type, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type functional receptor families. The iGluR assemblies are regulated by transcription, alternative splicing, and cytoplasmic post-translational modifications. The iGluR subunit proteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum, inserted into the synaptic membranes, and anchored at their action site by different scaffolding and interacting proteins. The functional properties of iGluRs depend on their subunit composition, the amino acid sequence of the protein domains, and the scaffolding proteins in the synaptic membranes. The iGluRs are removed from the membranes by enzymatic action and endocytosis. Hippocampal iGluRs are rearranged through the upregulation and downregulation of the subunits following deafferentation and epileptic seizures. The rearrangement of iGluRs and the alteration of their subunit composition transform neurons into “pathological” cells, determining the further plasticity or pathology of the hippocampal formation. In the present review, we summarize the expression of AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptor subunits following deafferentation, repeated mild seizures, and status epilepticus. We compare our results to literature descriptions, and draw conclusions as to the reactive plasticity of iGluRs in the hippocampus.\"\\n']"
