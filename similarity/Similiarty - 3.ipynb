Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of an e-health prevention programme for reducing tennis injury prevalence. Study design Two-arm, researcher-blinded randomised controlled trial. Methods Adult tennis players of all playing levels were randomised in an unsupervised programme lasting 12 weeks (TennisReady group or control group). The primary outcome was the overall injury prevalence over a 16-week period, measured at 2 weekly intervals with the Oslo Sports and Trauma Research Centre questionnaire. Estimates for the primary outcome and associated 95% CIs were obtained using generalised estimating equation models. Secondary outcome scores included prevalence of substantial injuries, overall incidence, adherence and time-loss injuries. Results A total of 579 (83%) (TennisReady n=286, control n=293) participants were included in the primary analysis. The mean injury prevalence was 37% (95% CI 33% to 42%) in the TennisReady vs 38% (95% CI 34% to 42%) in the control group (adjusted p-value 0.93). The prevalence of substantial injuries was 11% (95% CI 9% to 14%) in the TennisReady vs 12% (95% CI 9% to 15%) in the control group (p value of 0.79). Analysis of the secondary outcome scores showed no difference between groups.

       "      <td>Purpose To determine the volume and degree of asymmetry of the musculus rectus abdominis (RA) in professional tennis players. Methods The volume of the RA was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 8 professional male tennis players and 6 non-active male control subjects. Results Tennis players had 58% greater RA volume than controls (P = 0.01), due to hypertrophy of both the dominant (34% greater volume, P = 0.02) and non-dominant (82% greater volume, P = 0.01) sides, after accounting for age, the length of the RA muscle and body mass index (BMI) as covariates. In tennis players, there was a marked asymmetry in the development of the RA, which volume was 35% greater in the non-dominant compared to the dominant side (P&lt;0.001). In contrast, no side-to-side difference in RA volume was observed in the controls (P = 0.75). The degree of side-to-side asymmetry increased linearly from the first lumbar disc to the pubic symphysis (r = 0.97, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Professional tennis is associated with marked hypertrophy of the musculus rectus abdominis, which achieves a volume that is 58% greater than in non-active controls. Rectus abdominis hypertrophy is more marked in the non-dominant than in the dominant side, particularly in the more distal regions. Our study supports the concept that humans can differentially recruit both rectus abdominis but also the upper and lower regions of each muscle. It remains to be determined if this disequilibrium raises the risk of injury.</td>\n",

He had an 8-year history of crystal-proven gout with podagra and acute arthritis of both wrists. The gout had been inactive for years. He had an active lifestyle as a university professor, and frequently enjoyed gardening, tennis, fishing, and sailing. The patient presented with swelling and erythema of the dorsum of the right hand near the third and metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP). He had no pain or limitation of motion. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) agents improved the swelling temporarily but did not improve the erythema. He then developed tenderness and tightness of the palmar surface at the fourth MCP joint. Increased NSAID doses did not help. A bluish discoloration of the skin developed on the dorsal surface over the fourth MCP joint. Examination confirmed swelling over the third and fourth MCP joints. There was little pain with passive or active motion. Other right hand joints and those on the left hand were normal. There were no tophi and no adenopathy. Colchicine was given hourly, resulting in nausea and loose stools, but providing little improvement. For 2 weeks, and despite scheduled colchicine, all symptoms persisted. A radiograph of both hands and an aspiration of the right third MCP joint were performed. The results are summarized in Table 1. The crystal analysis led to a diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) disease. A repeat arthrocentesis and steroid injection added no relief.

       "      <td>he position statement of the American Geriatrics Society on Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) was published in the May T issue of the Journal,' and a relevant report by Rubenstein et a12 from a Task Force on Health Assessment of the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) is in this issue. We concur in the four positions taken by the AGS, although we believe it is important to stress two caveats, as previously emphasized in the NIH Consensus Development Conference statement3 and in associated ~ommentaries.~,~ The first is that, thus far, CGA has been found effective only in certain subgroups of geriatric patients, those neither \"too well\" nor too irreversibly disabled; thus, there is general agreement that targeting of CGA to the patients most likely to benefit is critical to successful assessment programs. The second caveat is that CGA is primarily a diagnostic, rather than a therapeutic, process; therefore, for optimal effectiveness, the assessment must be inextricably linked to the ongoing care of the patient, with the objective of assuring that the comprehensive care plan is implemented and modified as events may dictate. We would like to seize on this time of great interest in CGA to make some suggestions regarding nomenclature. As the literature of clinical geriatrics has proliferated, inconsistent terminology has hindered communication among those interested in the care of elderly persons. The most confusing example has been the use of the term, functional assessment (FA), as synonymous with CGA by some authors, while others view it in a more restrictive vein. We wish to propose the adoption of a common language to describe the assessment of older persons. Although preservation or restoration of function has been a principal goal of all geriatric assessment, we would suggest, for clarity, that the term functional assessment be reserved for the measurement of a patient's ability to complete functional tasks and fulfill social roles. Functional tasks can range from the simplest selfcare to executive-level occupational responsibilities. The first step in clarifying the description of these tasks would be to classify them into three levels of function, stratified according to difficulty and complexity into basic, intermediate and advanced activities of daily living (BADL, IADL, and AADL, respectively). BADLs include the elemental functions estimated by the Katz Index or similar scales of self-care IADLs have been measured as the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of Lawton and in the OARS instrument; they are symbolic of similar tasks essential to maintaining independen~e.\",~ Often, independence or dependence in these IADLs determines whether an elderly person can continue to live alone. AADLs may be thought of as \"luxury\" items of function, well beyond what is needed to maintan independent living. They tend to be volitional, specific to the individual and influenced by cultural and motivational forces. They usually relate to recreational, occupational, altruistic, or community service functions. Although not essential for independence, the AADLs may become an important area for future study, since one's capacity to continue AADLs may be conducive to strong mental health and certainly contribute to maintaining excellent quality of life. Furthermore, one might hypothesize that decline in the ability to perform AADLs might be a valuable early predictor of more senous functional decline. Some illustrative patterns of the effects of age-related disease on function in this threelevel model are diagrammed in Figure 1. Social function includes social activities, relationships, community and religious services, and employment. At the highest levels of ADLs and social function, the distinction between these two spheres often disappears. For example, a tennis match represents both a complex AADL and a social activity. Function may be assessed by self-report (either by the patient or a proxy), interview (either by the patient or a proxy), or by direct observation. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks, discussed most thoroughly by Kane and Kane'O and commented on further by Rubenstein, et a1.* Their value is dependent on the reliability of the source of information.

       "      <td>A generally held view in expert performance is that experts possess domain-specific rather than general skills. There is limited, if any, evidence to suggest that experts and novices may be differentiated on such general measures of performance as intelligence quotient, memory recall, visual function, or choice reaction time (see Williams, Davids, &amp; Williams, 1999). In a review of expertise and expert performance research, Ericsson and Lehmann (1996) concluded that the evidence for skill transfer from one domain to another is not conclusive. As a result of extended engagement within their chosen domain, experts acquire specific representations and mechanisms that support superior performance within, and rarely extend beyond, that domain (Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995). To improve performance in a given domain, individuals need to engage in deliberate practice activities that are challenging and facilitate development of the skills governing successful performance (see Ericsson, Krampe, &amp; Tesch-Romer, 1993). The cognitive representations experts acquire in their activity domain enable them to anticipate future retrieval demands, predict the outcome of a situation, and adapt rapidly to situational changes (Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995). For example, there is considerable empirical evidence to suggest that expert performers demonstrate superior anticipation skill when compared with less expert and novice counterparts (e.g., see Williams, North, Hodges, &amp; Barton, 2006). This ability to anticipate future events is an essential component of performance in many domains, such as law enforcement, automobile driving, military combat, and sport. For instance, expert drivers are able to anticipate hazardous traffic situations more effectively than novices by fixating further ahead in the road (see McKenna &amp; Horswill, 1999), whereas high-level pilots anticipate future flight demands, such as in the approach to landing, by fixating relevant instruments (i.e., airspeed indicator) and the runway aim-point more frequently than student pilots (Kasarskis, Stehwien, Hickox, Aretz, &amp; Wickens, 2001). In many racket sports, such as tennis and squash, experts are able to anticipate an opponent’s intended shot direction by fixating on relatively deterministic and proximal postural cues (such as trunk/hip rotation) before using more distal cues (e.g., racket) to confirm their initial perceptions (e.g., Williams, Ward, Knowles, &amp; Smeeton, 2002). An important issue is whether every expert exhibits these skills within the domain or whether an individual’s role or position in that domain more accurately characterizes expertise. The latter would certainly be in keeping with a long-term working memory of expert performance (see Ericsson &amp; Kintsch, 1995). This theory predicts that expertise is acquired as a result of specific adaptations that occur through extended exposure to unique demands of practice and performance. The notion of specificity is already fundamental to training theory in the biological sciences (Elliott &amp; Mester, 1998). In soccer, for example, there is evidence to suggest that the physiological demands imposed on athletes during match play vary markedly as a function of positional role (Drust, 1999), leading to the development of positionspecific fitness training programs (Reilly, 2005).

       "      <td>The importance of the centre of percussion (CP) of some hand-held sporting equipment (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries it is important that powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species.</td>\n",

       "      <td>• Fly Fishing: Sports Injuries Run Through lt Fly fishing seems like a low-impact activity performed in a serene setting; however, a researcher found that participants experience some of the same injuries as golfers, tennis players, and baseball players. Keith Berend, MD, chief orthopedic resident at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) in Durham, North Carolina, surveyed 131 participants about their health and fishing habits and found that 69% reported low-back pain, about 25% had pain in the hands and wrist, shoulder, or knee, and 18% had elbow pain. Berend reported his findings in July at the annual meeting of the Southern Orthopedic Association. Details of his study were issued in a DUMC press release. Shoulder, elbow, and wrist pain appeared to stem from the repetitive motion required to keep the fly active to mimic a live insect. A number of causes seemed to contribute to leg and back pain, including prolonged standing on rocky, uneven surfaces and overloaded or unevenly loaded fishing vests. Berend believes that improper casting technique, along with properties of the rod itself, might contribute to shoulder pain. He noted that he's planning to do a biomechanical study to better understand the demands of casting and to devise strategies to reduce pain and improve physical performance. Berend, himself an avid fly fisherman, advises participants to take the same basic injury precautions as for continued on page 16 NEWS BRIEFS</td>\n",

       "      <td>There is good evidence that physical activity reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease (1-6), possibly in part by lowering blood pressure (7). Although mild or moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking, is a recommended part of the treatment protocol for persons with hypertension (8, 9), it is not known whether mild physical activity, especially walking, reduces the risk for hypertension. With few exceptions, epidemiologic studies of physical activity and hypertension have been cross-sectional rather than prospective. Physical activity was inversely related to blood pressure in cross-sectional and controlled studies (7), and in two prospective studies (10, 11), vigorous exercise was inversely related to the subsequent risk for hypertension. Physicians in Japan usually advise their patients to walk to work as often as they can, and indeed, for middle-aged working Japanese men, the journey to and from work seems to be the main source of exercise. We prospectively examined the relation of mild physical activity, especially walking to work, and leisure-time physical activity to the risk for hypertension during 6 to 16 years of observation. Methods The Osaka Health Survey The Osaka Health Survey is an ongoing cohort study of risk factors for chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes. Study participants are male employees of a gas company in Osaka, Japan. Japanese law requires all employers to conduct annual health screenings for all employees. For the purposes of the Osaka Health Survey, in addition to these annual screenings, all employees 35 years of age or older undergo more detailed biennial clinical examinations and complete questionnaires on health-related behaviors, including exercise. Study Sample Between 1981 and 1990, 7979 Japanese men 35 to 63 years of age at entry who had sedentary occupations were enrolled in the study. We excluded 1875 men because they had physician-diagnosed hypertension, borderline hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140 and&lt;160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 90 and&lt;95 mm Hg, or both in men without a history of hypertension), diabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose level 6.1 mmol/L [ 110 mg/dL] and&lt;7.8 mmol/L [&lt;140 mg/dL] in men with no history of diabetes) at entry. The study sample ultimately consisted of 6104 men. Data Collection and Measurements The biennial clinical examination consisted of a medical history; a physical examination; blood pressure measurement; anthropometric measurements; measurement of the fasting plasma glucose level; and surveys of health-related behaviors, such as physical activity, smoking, and daily alcohol consumption. Trained nurses took all measurements. Participants were asked to fast for 12 hours and to avoid smoking and heavy physical activity for more than 2 hours before the examination. After a 5-minute rest in a quiet room, a standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the right arm while the participant was seated. Pressure was measured twice, at an interval of a few minutes. Anthropometric measurements included height and body weight, which were measured while the participant was wearing light clothing without shoes. Body mass index was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared. The questionnaire completed by each participant elicited information on leisure-time physical activity, the duration of the walk to work, the nature of the participant's occupation, and the level of activity involved. Leisure-time physical activity was defined as physical activity unrelated to the participant's work. Questions about leisure-time physical activity were as follows: Do you engage in any regular physical exercise, such as jogging, bicycling, swimming, and tennis, long enough to work up a sweat (lasting 30 minutes or more)? If yes, how many times per week? What exercise is this? The questions about regular physical exercise have been validated as a measure of physical exercise (12-15). In the analysis, participants were classified as engaging in regular physical exercise at least once per week or less than once per week. They were also classified into one of three categories of exercise frequency: 0 (less than once per week), once per week, or two or more times per week. The question about the duration of the walk to work was How long does it take you to walk to this office? Occupational activity was scored as 1 if the participant's work was mostly sedentary and 2 if he worked outside or if the job required a lot of lifting and walking. In the present study, we excluded all participants who reported a score of 2 for their occupational activities. Questions about alcohol intake included items about the type of alcoholic beverage, the weekly frequency of alcohol consumption, and the usual amount consumed daily. Alcohol intake was converted to total alcohol consumption (in milliliters of ethanol per day) by using standard Japanese tables. Current and past smoking habits were classified according to the type and quantity of cigarettes smoked daily. Participants were classified as current smokers, past smokers, or nonsmokers. Hypertension was also diagnosed during the biennial study clinical examinations. All participants underwent medical screening by a physician at least once annually, and hypertension was also diagnosed by the physicians. Hypertension was defined by using World Health Organization criteria as physician-diagnosed hypertension (systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 95 mm Hg, or both) or use of antihypertensive medication (16). Statistical Analysis Age-adjusted mean values and relevant population characteristics were computed for the duration of the walk to work by using analysis of covariance for continuous variables and the direct method for categorical variables. For each participant, person-years of follow-up were counted from the date at study entry to the date of diagnosis of hypertension or 1 April 1997, whichever came first. The rate of follow-up was 94% of the total potential person-years of follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effects of the duration of the walk to work, the frequency of leisure-time physical activity, age, body mass index, daily alcohol consumption, smoking status, and fasting plasma glucose level. Baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not included in our primary analyses because they could presumably be in the causal pathway between the exposures (such as physical activity, age, body mass index, and alcohol consumption) and risk for hypertension. However, we included systolic and diastolic blood pressure in further models to assess the effect of physical activity on the risk for hypertension independent of their effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The linear trends in risks were evaluated by entering indicators for each categorical level of exposure or by using the median value for each category. As a reference category, we used men with the lowest level of physical activity. To address the potential misclassification of leisure-time physical activity over time, additional analyses were performed on the basis of the data at both study entry (1981 to 1990) and the examination done 4 years after (1985 to 1994) each participant was enrolled. We also performed analyses that excluded participants who developed hypertension between study entry (1981 to 1990) and the third examination done 4 years later (1985 to 1994). We calculated the 95% CI for each relative risk (17), and all P values are two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed by using the SPSS 7.5J software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). We estimated the number needed to walk, a value analogous to the number needed to treat. The number needed to treat for a given therapy is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction for that treatment (18). A 95% CI for the number needed to treat is obtained simply by taking reciprocals of the values defining the 95% CI of the absolute risk reduction (19). In our study, the number needed to walk was defined as the number of men who would have to adopt walking to avoid a single case of hypertension. The number needed to treat must always be based on an outcome for a specific period of time (20); thus, in estimating the number needed to walk, we chose an observation period of 10 years between study entry (1981 to 1986) and the examination done 10 years after (1991 to 1996) each participant was enrolled. Role of the Funding Source The funding agencies did not participate in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data presented in this report or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Results Of the 6104 men eligible for this study between 1981 and 1990, we excluded 87 men who did not undergo medical check-ups during the follow-up period. The study sample for analysis consisted of 6017 men. During the 59 784 person-years of follow-up between 1981 and 1997, 626 men developed hypertension. As the duration of the walk to work increased, body weight and the body mass index decreased (P for trend=0.037 and 0.035, respectively) (Table 1). We identified no significant relation between the duration of the walk to work and the levels of leisure-time physical activity (P for trend=0.062). Table 1. Baseline Characteristics according to Duration of the Walk to Work Duration of the Walk to Work The duration of the walk to work was associated with a decreased risk for incident hypertension (Table 2). After adjustment for age, body mass index, daily alcohol consumption, smoking status, frequency of leisure-time physical activity, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose level, the relative risk for hypertension was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97) in men whose walk to work lasted 21 minutes or more compared with those whose</td>\n",

Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of an e-health prevention programme for reducing tennis injury prevalence. Study design Two-arm, researcher-blinded randomised controlled trial. Methods Adult tennis players of all playing levels were randomised in an unsupervised programme lasting 12 weeks (TennisReady group or control group). The primary outcome was the overall injury prevalence over a 16-week period, measured at 2 weekly intervals with the Oslo Sports and Trauma Research Centre questionnaire. Estimates for the primary outcome and associated 95% CIs were obtained using generalised estimating equation models. Secondary outcome scores included prevalence of substantial injuries, overall incidence, adherence and time-loss injuries. Results A total of 579 (83%) (TennisReady n=286, control n=293) participants were included in the primary analysis. The mean injury prevalence was 37% (95% CI 33% to 42%) in the TennisReady vs 38% (95% CI 34% to 42%) in the control group (adjusted p-value 0.93). The prevalence of substantial injuries was 11% (95% CI 9% to 14%) in the TennisReady vs 12% (95% CI 9% to 15%) in the control group (p value of 0.79). Analysis of the secondary outcome scores showed no difference between groups. The mean prevalence rates between high (8%) and low (92%) adherent groups were 32% (95% CI 23% to 44%) and 37% (95% CI 33% to 42%), respectively (p value 0.36). Conclusion Providing an unsupervised e-health tennis-specific exercise programme did not reduce the injury rates and should not be implemented. Trial registration number NTR6443.   \n",

Methods The volume of the RA was determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 8 professional male tennis players and 6 non-active male control subjects. Results Tennis players had 58% greater RA volume than controls (P = 0.01), due to hypertrophy of both the dominant (34% greater volume, P = 0.02) and non-dominant (82% greater volume, P = 0.01) sides, after accounting for age, the length of the RA muscle and body mass index (BMI) as covariates. In tennis players, there was a marked asymmetry in the development of the RA, which volume was 35% greater in the non-dominant compared to the dominant side (P<0.001). In contrast, no side-to-side difference in RA volume was observed in the controls (P = 0.75). The degree of side-to-side asymmetry increased linearly from the first lumbar disc to the pubic symphysis (r = 0.97, P<0.001). Conclusions Professional tennis is associated with marked hypertrophy of the musculus rectus abdominis, which achieves a volume that is 58% greater than in non-active controls. Rectus abdominis hypertrophy is more marked in the non-dominant than in the dominant side, particularly in the more distal regions. Our study supports the concept that humans can differentially recruit both rectus abdominis but also the upper and lower regions of each muscle. It remains to be determined if this disequilibrium raises the risk of injury.   \n",

He had an 8-year history of crystal-proven gout with podagra and acute arthritis of both wrists. The gout had been inactive for years. He had an active lifestyle as a university professor, and frequently enjoyed gardening, tennis, fishing, and sailing. The patient presented with swelling and erythema of the dorsum of the right hand near the third and metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP). He had no pain or limitation of motion. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) agents improved the swelling temporarily but did not improve the erythema. He then developed tenderness and tightness of the palmar surface at the fourth MCP joint. Increased NSAID doses did not help. A bluish discoloration of the skin developed on the dorsal surface over the fourth MCP joint. Examination confirmed swelling over the third and fourth MCP joints. There was little pain with passive or active motion. Other right hand joints and those on the left hand were normal. There were no tophi and no adenopathy. Colchicine was given hourly, resulting in nausea and loose stools, but providing little improvement. For 2 weeks, and despite scheduled colchicine, all symptoms persisted. A radiograph of both hands and an aspiration of the right third MCP joint were performed. The results are summarized in Table 1. The crystal analysis led to a diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) disease. A repeat arthrocentesis and steroid injection added no relief. An erythematous nodule appeared at the palmar aspect of the terminal digit. An ultrasound of the nodule was obtained to exclude a foreign body. A complete physical exam was performed. The patient’s weight was 71 kg, blood pressure 154188, temperature 36.2”, and pulse 76. There was no adenopathy. The nails and skin were normal, and there were no tophi. The heart was slightly   \n",

published in the May T issue of the Journal,' and a relevant report by Rubenstein et a12 from a Task Force on Health Assessment of the Society of General Internal Medicine (SGIM) is in this issue. We concur in the four positions taken by the AGS, although we believe it is important to stress two caveats, as previously emphasized in the NIH Consensus Development Conference statement3 and in associated ~ommentaries.~,~ The first is that, thus far, CGA has been found effective only in certain subgroups of geriatric patients, those neither \"too well\" nor too irreversibly disabled; thus, there is general agreement that targeting of CGA to the patients most likely to benefit is critical to successful assessment programs. The second caveat is that CGA is primarily a diagnostic, rather than a therapeutic, process; therefore, for optimal effectiveness, the assessment must be inextricably linked to the ongoing care of the patient, with the objective of assuring that the comprehensive care plan is implemented and modified as events may dictate. We would like to seize on this time of great interest in CGA to make some suggestions regarding nomenclature. As the literature of clinical geriatrics has proliferated, inconsistent terminology has hindered communication among those interested in the care of elderly persons. The most confusing example has been the use of the term, functional assessment (FA), as synonymous with CGA by some authors, while others view it in a more restrictive vein. We wish to propose the adoption of a common language to describe the assessment of older persons. Although preservation or restoration of function has been a principal goal of all geriatric assessment, we would suggest, for clarity, that the term functional assessment be reserved for the measurement of a patient's ability to complete functional tasks and fulfill social roles. Functional tasks can range from the simplest selfcare to executive-level occupational responsibilities. The first step in clarifying the description of these tasks would be to classify them into three levels of function, stratified according to difficulty and complexity into basic, intermediate and advanced activities of daily living (BADL, IADL, and AADL, respectively). BADLs include the elemental functions estimated by the Katz Index or similar scales of self-care IADLs have been measured as the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of Lawton and in the OARS instrument; they are symbolic of similar tasks essential to maintaining independen~e.\",~ Often, independence or dependence in these IADLs determines whether an elderly person can continue to live alone. AADLs may be thought of as \"luxury\" items of function, well beyond what is needed to maintan independent living. They tend to be volitional, specific to the individual and influenced by cultural and motivational forces. They usually relate to recreational, occupational, altruistic, or community service functions. Although not essential for independence, the AADLs may become an important area for future study, since one's capacity to continue AADLs may be conducive to strong mental health and certainly contribute to maintaining excellent quality of life. Furthermore, one might hypothesize that decline in the ability to perform AADLs might be a valuable early predictor of more senous functional decline. Some illustrative patterns of the effects of age-related disease on function in this threelevel model are diagrammed in Figure 1. Social function includes social activities, relationships, community and religious services, and employment. At the highest levels of ADLs and social function, the distinction between these two spheres often disappears. For example, a tennis match represents both a complex AADL and a social activity. Function may be assessed by self-report (either by the patient or a proxy), interview (either by the patient or a proxy), or by direct observation. Each of these methods has its advantages and drawbacks, discussed most thoroughly by Kane and Kane'O and commented on further by Rubenstein, et a1.* Their value is dependent on the reliability of the source of information.

held view in expert performance is that experts possess domain-specific rather than general skills. There is limited, if any, evidence to suggest that experts and novices may be differentiated on such general measures of performance as intelligence quotient, memory recall, visual function, or choice reaction time (see Williams, Davids, & Williams, 1999). In a review of expertise and expert performance research, Ericsson and Lehmann (1996) concluded that the evidence for skill transfer from one domain to another is not conclusive. As a result of extended engagement within their chosen domain, experts acquire specific representations and mechanisms that support superior performance within, and rarely extend beyond, that domain (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). To improve performance in a given domain, individuals need to engage in deliberate practice activities that are challenging and facilitate development of the skills governing successful performance (see Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Romer, 1993). The cognitive representations experts acquire in their activity domain enable them to anticipate future retrieval demands, predict the outcome of a situation, and adapt rapidly to situational changes (Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). For example, there is considerable empirical evidence to suggest that expert performers demonstrate superior anticipation skill when compared with less expert and novice counterparts (e.g., see Williams, North, Hodges, & Barton, 2006). This ability to anticipate future events is an essential component of performance in many domains, such as law enforcement, automobile driving, military combat, and sport. For instance, expert drivers are able to anticipate hazardous traffic situations more effectively than novices by fixating further ahead in the road (see McKenna & Horswill, 1999), whereas high-level pilots anticipate future flight demands, such as in the approach to landing, by fixating relevant instruments (i.e., airspeed indicator) and the runway aim-point more frequently than student pilots (Kasarskis, Stehwien, Hickox, Aretz, & Wickens, 2001). In many racket sports, such as tennis and squash, experts are able to anticipate an opponent’s intended shot direction by fixating on relatively deterministic and proximal postural cues (such as trunk/hip rotation) before using more distal cues (e.g., racket) to confirm their initial perceptions (e.g., Williams, Ward, Knowles, & Smeeton, 2002). An important issue is whether every expert exhibits these skills within the domain or whether an individual’s role or position in that domain more accurately characterizes expertise. The latter would certainly be in keeping with a long-term working memory of expert performance (see Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). This theory predicts that expertise is acquired as a result of specific adaptations that occur through extended exposure to unique demands of practice and performance. The notion of specificity is already fundamental to training theory in the biological sciences (Elliott & Mester, 1998). In soccer, for example, there is evidence to suggest that the physiological demands imposed on athletes during match play vary markedly as a function of positional role (Drust, 1999), leading to the development of positionspecific fitness training programs (Reilly, 2005).

percussion (CP) of some hand-held sporting equipment (such as tennis rackets and baseball bats) for athletic performance is well known. In order to avoid injuries it is important that powerful blows are located close to the CP. Several species of glyptodont (giant armoured mammals) had tail clubs that can be modelled as rigid beams (like baseball bats) and it is generally assumed that these were useful for agonistic behaviour. However, the variation in tail club morphology among known genera suggests that a biomechanical and functional analysis of these structures could be useful. Here, we outline a novel method to determine the CP of the glyptodont tail clubs. We find that the largest species had the CP very close to the possible location of horny spikes. This is consistent with the inference that they were adapted to delivering powerful blows at that point. Our new analysis reinforces the case for agonistic use of tail clubs in several glyptodont species.   \n",

activity performed in a serene setting; however, a researcher found that participants experience some of the same injuries as golfers, tennis players, and baseball players. Keith Berend, MD, chief orthopedic resident at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) in Durham, North Carolina, surveyed 131 participants about their health and fishing habits and found that 69% reported low-back pain, about 25% had pain in the hands and wrist, shoulder, or knee, and 18% had elbow pain. Berend reported his findings in July at the annual meeting of the Southern Orthopedic Association. Details of his study were issued in a DUMC press release. Shoulder, elbow, and wrist pain appeared to stem from the repetitive motion required to keep the fly active to mimic a live insect. A number of causes seemed to contribute to leg and back pain, including prolonged standing on rocky, uneven surfaces and overloaded or unevenly loaded fishing vests. Berend believes that improper casting technique, along with properties of the rod itself, might contribute to shoulder pain. He noted that he's planning to do a biomechanical study to better understand the demands of casting and to devise strategies to reduce pain and improve physical performance. Berend, himself an avid fly fisherman, advises participants to take the same basic injury precautions as for continued on page 16 NEWS BRIEFS   \n",
       "90  There is good evidence that physical activity reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease (1-6), possibly in part by lowering blood pressure (7). Although mild or moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking, is a recommended part of the treatment protocol for persons with hypertension (8, 9), it is not known whether mild physical activity, especially walking, reduces the risk for hypertension. With few exceptions, epidemiologic studies of physical activity and hypertension have been cross-sectional rather than prospective. Physical activity was inversely related to blood pressure in cross-sectional and controlled studies (7), and in two prospective studies (10, 11), vigorous exercise was inversely related to the subsequent risk for hypertension. Physicians in Japan usually advise their patients to walk to work as often as they can, and indeed, for middle-aged working Japanese men, the journey to and from work seems to be the main source of exercise. We prospectively examined the relation of mild physical activity, especially walking to work, and leisure-time physical activity to the risk for hypertension during 6 to 16 years of observation. Methods The Osaka Health Survey The Osaka Health Survey is an ongoing cohort study of risk factors for chronic diseases, including hypertension and diabetes. Study participants are male employees of a gas company in Osaka, Japan. Japanese law requires all employers to conduct annual health screenings for all employees. For the purposes of the Osaka Health Survey, in addition to these annual screenings, all employees 35 years of age or older undergo more detailed biennial clinical examinations and complete questionnaires on health-related behaviors, including exercise. Study Sample Between 1981 and 1990, 7979 Japanese men 35 to 63 years of age at entry who had sedentary occupations were enrolled in the study. We excluded 1875 men because they had physician-diagnosed hypertension, borderline hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140 and<160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 90 and<95 mm Hg, or both in men without a history of hypertension), diabetes, or impaired glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose level 6.1 mmol/L [ 110 mg/dL] and<7.8 mmol/L [<140 mg/dL] in men with no history of diabetes) at entry. The study sample ultimately consisted of 6104 men. Data Collection and Measurements The biennial clinical examination consisted of a medical history; a physical examination; blood pressure measurement; anthropometric measurements; measurement of the fasting plasma glucose level; and surveys of health-related behaviors, such as physical activity, smoking, and daily alcohol consumption. Trained nurses took all measurements. Participants were asked to fast for 12 hours and to avoid smoking and heavy physical activity for more than 2 hours before the examination. After a 5-minute rest in a quiet room, a standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to measure systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the right arm while the participant was seated. Pressure was measured twice, at an interval of a few minutes. Anthropometric measurements included height and body weight, which were measured while the participant was wearing light clothing without shoes. Body mass index was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared. The questionnaire completed by each participant elicited information on leisure-time physical activity, the duration of the walk to work, the nature of the participant's occupation, and the level of activity involved. Leisure-time physical activity was defined as physical activity unrelated to the participant's work. Questions about leisure-time physical activity were as follows: Do you engage in any regular physical exercise, such as jogging, bicycling, swimming, and tennis, long enough to work up a sweat (lasting 30 minutes or more)? If yes, how many times per week? What exercise is this? The questions about regular physical exercise have been validated as a measure of physical exercise (12-15). In the analysis, participants were classified as engaging in regular physical exercise at least once per week or less than once per week. They were also classified into one of three categories of exercise frequency: 0 (less than once per week), once per week, or two or more times per week. The question about the duration of the walk to work was How long does it take you to walk to this office? Occupational activity was scored as 1 if the participant's work was mostly sedentary and 2 if he worked outside or if the job required a lot of lifting and walking. In the present study, we excluded all participants who reported a score of 2 for their occupational activities. Questions about alcohol intake included items about the type of alcoholic beverage, the weekly frequency of alcohol consumption, and the usual amount consumed daily. Alcohol intake was converted to total alcohol consumption (in milliliters of ethanol per day) by using standard Japanese tables. Current and past smoking habits were classified according to the type and quantity of cigarettes smoked daily. Participants were classified as current smokers, past smokers, or nonsmokers. Hypertension was also diagnosed during the biennial study clinical examinations. All participants underwent medical screening by a physician at least once annually, and hypertension was also diagnosed by the physicians. Hypertension was defined by using World Health Organization criteria as physician-diagnosed hypertension (systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 95 mm Hg, or both) or use of antihypertensive medication (16). Statistical Analysis Age-adjusted mean values and relevant population characteristics were computed for the duration of the walk to work by using analysis of covariance for continuous variables and the direct method for categorical variables. For each participant, person-years of follow-up were counted from the date at study entry to the date of diagnosis of hypertension or 1 April 1997, whichever came first. The rate of follow-up was 94% of the total potential person-years of follow-up. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to evaluate the simultaneous effects of the duration of the walk to work, the frequency of leisure-time physical activity, age, body mass index, daily alcohol consumption, smoking status, and fasting plasma glucose level. Baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure were not included in our primary analyses because they could presumably be in the causal pathway between the exposures (such as physical activity, age, body mass index, and alcohol consumption) and risk for hypertension. However, we included systolic and diastolic blood pressure in further models to assess the effect of physical activity on the risk for hypertension independent of their effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The linear trends in risks were evaluated by entering indicators for each categorical level of exposure or by using the median value for each category. As a reference category, we used men with the lowest level of physical activity. To address the potential misclassification of leisure-time physical activity over time, additional analyses were performed on the basis of the data at both study entry (1981 to 1990) and the examination done 4 years after (1985 to 1994) each participant was enrolled. We also performed analyses that excluded participants who developed hypertension between study entry (1981 to 1990) and the third examination done 4 years later (1985 to 1994). We calculated the 95% CI for each relative risk (17), and all P values are two-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed by using the SPSS 7.5J software package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois). We estimated the number needed to walk, a value analogous to the number needed to treat. The number needed to treat for a given therapy is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction for that treatment (18). A 95% CI for the number needed to treat is obtained simply by taking reciprocals of the values defining the 95% CI of the absolute risk reduction (19). In our study, the number needed to walk was defined as the number of men who would have to adopt walking to avoid a single case of hypertension. The number needed to treat must always be based on an outcome for a specific period of time (20); thus, in estimating the number needed to walk, we chose an observation period of 10 years between study entry (1981 to 1986) and the examination done 10 years after (1991 to 1996) each participant was enrolled. Role of the Funding Source The funding agencies did not participate in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of data presented in this report or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. Results Of the 6104 men eligible for this study between 1981 and 1990, we excluded 87 men who did not undergo medical check-ups during the follow-up period. The study sample for analysis consisted of 6017 men. During the 59 784 person-years of follow-up between 1981 and 1997, 626 men developed hypertension. As the duration of the walk to work increased, body weight and the body mass index decreased (P for trend=0.037 and 0.035, respectively) (Table 1). We identified no significant relation between the duration of the walk to work and the levels of leisure-time physical activity (P for trend=0.062). Table 1. Baseline Characteristics according to Duration of the Walk to Work Duration of the Walk to Work The duration of the walk to work was associated with a decreased risk for incident hypertension (Table 2). After adjustment for age, body mass index, daily alcohol consumption, smoking status, frequency of leisure-time physical activity, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose level, the relative risk for hypertension was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97) in men whose walk to work lasted 21 minutes or more compared with those whose   \n",

The mean age in the study group (&gt;75 years) was 78.19 ± 2.7 years and 58.97 ± 8.5 in the control group. At 1-year follow-up the global success rate was 83.6% and did not significantly differ between older (10/53) and younger patients (16/106) (81.1 vs. 84.9%, P = 0.54). Transient phrenic nerve palsy was the most common complication which occurred in eight patients in the younger group and in three in the older group (7.5 vs. 5.7%, respectively, P = 0.66).\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe results of our study showed that CB-A for the treatment of PAF is a feasible and safe procedure in elderly patients, with similar success and complications rates when compared with a younger population.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aims To perform an updated meta-analysis to assess efficacy, safety and technical performance of pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon or radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Methods In June 2017, databases and websites were systematically searched for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting data on efficacy, safety and technical performance outcomes at follow-up at least 12 months. Researchers independently assessed records’ eligibility, inclusion and methodological quality of included studies. Results Six randomized controlled trials and 25 observational studies – 11 853 patients were included. Studies on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were 29 and included 11 635 patients. Meta-analysis results showed no difference between cryoballoon and radiofrequency in terms of recurrent atrial fibrillation [risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.10] or atrial tachyarrhythmias (risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1–1.08) and fluoroscopy time (mean difference −1.92 min, 95% CI −4.89 to 1.05). Cryoballoon ablation was associated with fewer reablations (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.98), lower incidence of pericardial effusion (risk ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.89) and cardiac tamponade (risk ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.18–0.62) and shorter total procedural time (mean difference −23.48 min, 95% CI −37.97; −9.02) but with higher incidence of phrenic nerve palsy (risk ratio 5.43, 95% CI 2.67–11.04). Prespecified subgroup analysis confirmed overall results as for freedom from atrial fibrillation and atrial tachyarrhythmias. Only two observational studies included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, thus hindering any conclusion in this population. Conclusion In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation produce similar results in terms of freedom from recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial tachyarrhythmias but with a different safety profile, being cryoballoon ablation less associated with cardiac complications but more likely to cause phrenic nerve palsy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Rationale: Bilateral brachial plexus block (BPB) generally requires a relatively large dose of local anesthetic for a successful block, resulting in a high risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. It can also result in inadvertent bilateral phrenic nerve palsy, leading to respiratory failure. Hence, it has not been widely used. However, it can be performed in selected patients. In this report, we present a case of ultrasound-guided BPB for bilateral upper extremity surgery in a patient with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Patient concerns: A 25-year-old woman with SCI secondary to traumatic fifth cervical spine fracture scheduled for surgical treatment of bilateral elbow fracture received bilateral BPB. Diagnoses: Due to the complications of SCI, the patient had incomplete sensory loss, loss of motor function, and complete diaphragmatic paralysis on the right side. Interventions: Right infraclavicular and left axillary BPB was performed as the sole anesthetic procedure for bilateral upper extremity surgery. Outcomes: Bilateral BPB was successful for bilateral upper extremity surgery. The surgery was uneventful and without further complications. Lessons: Patients with cervical SCI have a high risk of respiratory complications. Bilateral BPB can be a suitable option for bilateral upper extremity surgery in selected patients. It is imperative to select an appropriate anesthetic technique that preserves respiratory function to minimize the potential risk of respiratory complications.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Catheter ablation has become a well-established indication for long-term rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients refractory to anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs). Efficacy and safety of AF catheter ablation (AFCA) before AADs failure are, instead, questioned. Objective: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing first-line AFCA with AADs in symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods: We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of binary outcome events comparing AFCA with AADs in rhythm control-naïve patients. The primary outcomes, also stratified by the type of ablation energy (radiofrequency or cryoenergy), were (1) recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and (2) recurrence of symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmias. The secondary outcomes included adverse events. Results: Six RCTs were included in the analysis. AFCA was associated with lower recurrences of atrial tachyarrhythmias [relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46–0.72], consistent across the two types of ablation energy (radiofrequency, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.89; cryoenergy, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.72; p-value for subgroup differences: 0.55). Similarly, AFCA was related to less symptomatic arrhythmic recurrences (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27–0.79). Overall, adverse events did not differ. A trend toward increased periprocedural cardiac tamponade or phrenic nerve palsy was observed in the AFCA group, while more atrial flutter episodes with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and syncopal events were reported in the AAD group. Conclusions: First-line rhythm control therapy with AFCA, independent from the adopted energy source (radiofrequency or cryoenergy), reduces long-term arrhythmic recurrences in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF compared with AADs.</td>\n",

Recent findings Recent reports show positive outcomes on both unilateral and bilateral reinnervations. The phrenic nerve is the most commonly used donor for bilateral vocal palsy, but use of the superior laryngeal nerve has also been suggested. Summary Reinnervation of the larynx is a complex undertaking that can be performed by ENT surgeons with skills in microsurgery. Advances in this this field represent a paradigm shift in laryngeal rehabilitation and a prerequisite for laryngeal transplantation. Advances in basic understanding of nerve regeneration and in particular the need to surgically manage competitive reinnervation make the results of laryngeal reinnervation more predictable.</td>\n",

Findings: The 58-year-old woman with a history of bilateral optic neuritis presented to the emergency department with rapidly worsening dyspnea. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive abnormal signal with involvement of the medulla oblongata. Since in our patient chest radiography failed to disclose a diaphragmatic palsy that is commonly observed in patients with phrenic nerve involvement, this acute manifestation of the disease may be attributed to brainstem involvement instead of cervical myelitis.

The mean age in the study group (>75 years) was 78.19 ± 2.7 years and 58.97 ± 8.5 in the control group. At 1-year follow-up the global success rate was 83.6% and did not significantly differ between older (10/53) and younger patients (16/106) (81.1 vs. 84.9%, P = 0.54). Transient phrenic nerve palsy was the most common complication which occurred in eight patients in the younger group and in three in the older group (7.5 vs. 5.7%, respectively, P = 0.66).\\n\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe results of our study showed that CB-A for the treatment of PAF is a feasible and safe procedure in elderly patients, with similar success and complications rates when compared with a younger population.   \n",

       "2  Aims To perform an updated meta-analysis to assess efficacy, safety and technical performance of pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon or radiofrequency catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Methods In June 2017, databases and websites were systematically searched for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting data on efficacy, safety and technical performance outcomes at follow-up at least 12 months. Researchers independently assessed records’ eligibility, inclusion and methodological quality of included studies. Results Six randomized controlled trials and 25 observational studies – 11 853 patients were included. Studies on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were 29 and included 11 635 patients. Meta-analysis results showed no difference between cryoballoon and radiofrequency in terms of recurrent atrial fibrillation [risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.10] or atrial tachyarrhythmias (risk ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1–1.08) and fluoroscopy time (mean difference −1.92 min, 95% CI −4.89 to 1.05). Cryoballoon ablation was associated with fewer reablations (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.98), lower incidence of pericardial effusion (risk ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31–0.89) and cardiac tamponade (risk ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.18–0.62) and shorter total procedural time (mean difference −23.48 min, 95% CI −37.97; −9.02) but with higher incidence of phrenic nerve palsy (risk ratio 5.43, 95% CI 2.67–11.04). Prespecified subgroup analysis confirmed overall results as for freedom from atrial fibrillation and atrial tachyarrhythmias. Only two observational studies included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, thus hindering any conclusion in this population. Conclusion In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation produce similar results in terms of freedom from recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial tachyarrhythmias but with a different safety profile, being cryoballoon ablation less associated with cardiac complications but more likely to cause phrenic nerve palsy.   \n",

It can also result in inadvertent bilateral phrenic nerve palsy, leading to respiratory failure. Hence, it has not been widely used. However, it can be performed in selected patients. In this report, we present a case of ultrasound-guided BPB for bilateral upper extremity surgery in a patient with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Patient concerns: A 25-year-old woman with SCI secondary to traumatic fifth cervical spine fracture scheduled for surgical treatment of bilateral elbow fracture received bilateral BPB. Diagnoses: Due to the complications of SCI, the patient had incomplete sensory loss, loss of motor function, and complete diaphragmatic paralysis on the right side. Interventions: Right infraclavicular and left axillary BPB was performed as the sole anesthetic procedure for bilateral upper extremity surgery. Outcomes: Bilateral BPB was successful for bilateral upper extremity surgery. The surgery was uneventful and without further complications. Lessons: Patients with cervical SCI have a high risk of respiratory complications. Bilateral BPB can be a suitable option for bilateral upper extremity surgery in selected patients. It is imperative to select an appropriate anesthetic technique that preserves respiratory function to minimize the potential risk of respiratory complications.   \n",

Electrophysiologic studies showed an acute motor axonal neuropathy. Serum anti‐GM1 IgG antibody was positive. Intavenous immunoglobulin treatment resulted in good clinical recovery. The present report indicates that the cranial and phrenic nerves may be affected unilaterally in Guillain–Barré syndrome, and that there is clinical variability in the axonal subtype of this syndrome. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Efficacy and safety of AF catheter ablation (AFCA) before AADs failure are, instead, questioned. Objective: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing first-line AFCA with AADs in symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods: We performed a random-effects meta-analysis of binary outcome events comparing AFCA with AADs in rhythm control-naïve patients. The primary outcomes, also stratified by the type of ablation energy (radiofrequency or cryoenergy), were (1) recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and (2) recurrence of symptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmias. The secondary outcomes included adverse events. Results: Six RCTs were included in the analysis. AFCA was associated with lower recurrences of atrial tachyarrhythmias [relative risk (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46–0.72], consistent across the two types of ablation energy (radiofrequency, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28–0.89; cryoenergy, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.72; p-value for subgroup differences: 0.55). Similarly, AFCA was related to less symptomatic arrhythmic recurrences (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27–0.79). Overall, adverse events did not differ. A trend toward increased periprocedural cardiac tamponade or phrenic nerve palsy was observed in the AFCA group, while more atrial flutter episodes with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and syncopal events were reported in the AAD group. Conclusions: First-line rhythm control therapy with AFCA, independent from the adopted energy source (radiofrequency or cryoenergy), reduces long-term arrhythmic recurrences in patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF compared with AADs.   \n",

Recent findings Recent reports show positive outcomes on both unilateral and bilateral reinnervations. The phrenic nerve is the most commonly used donor for bilateral vocal palsy, but use of the superior laryngeal nerve has also been suggested. Summary Reinnervation of the larynx is a complex undertaking that can be performed by ENT surgeons with skills in microsurgery. Advances in this this field represent a paradigm shift in laryngeal rehabilitation and a prerequisite for laryngeal transplantation. Advances in basic understanding of nerve regeneration and in particular the need to surgically manage competitive reinnervation make the results of laryngeal reinnervation more predictable.   \n",

When conservative measures fail to achieve adequate ventilation, then early surgical plication has been found to be associated with good outcome. We report a case of neonate with phrenic nerve palsy in whom an early thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication was done.   \n",

We report an unusual case of NMO relapse presenting with rapidly progressive respiratory failure and briefly discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this potential life-threatening complication of NMO. Findings: The 58-year-old woman with a history of bilateral optic neuritis presented to the emergency department with rapidly worsening dyspnea. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive abnormal signal with involvement of the medulla oblongata. Since in our patient chest radiography failed to disclose a diaphragmatic palsy that is commonly observed in patients with phrenic nerve involvement, this acute manifestation of the disease may be attributed to brainstem involvement instead of cervical myelitis.

       "      <td>Purpose of review To present the current state of knowledge concerning different laryngeal reinnervation procedures for unilateral and bilateral vocal palsy. Recent findings Recent reports show positive outcomes on both unilateral and bilateral reinnervations. The phrenic nerve is the most commonly used donor for bilateral vocal palsy, but use of the superior laryngeal nerve has also been suggested. Summary Reinnervation of the larynx is a complex undertaking that can be performed by ENT surgeons with skills in microsurgery. Advances in this this field represent a paradigm shift in laryngeal rehabilitation and a prerequisite for laryngeal transplantation. Advances in basic understanding of nerve regeneration and in particular the need to surgically manage competitive reinnervation make the results of laryngeal reinnervation more predictable.</td>\n",

Electrophysiologic studies showed an acute motor axonal neuropathy. Serum anti‐GM1 IgG antibody was positive. Intavenous immunoglobulin treatment resulted in good clinical recovery. The present report indicates that the cranial and phrenic nerves may be affected unilaterally in Guillain–Barré syndrome, and that there is clinical variability in the axonal subtype of this syndrome. © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

       "      <td>Context: Dyspnea has rarely been reported as a presenting symptom in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO). We report an unusual case of NMO relapse presenting with rapidly progressive respiratory failure and briefly discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this potential life-threatening complication of NMO. Findings: The 58-year-old woman with a history of bilateral optic neuritis presented to the emergency department with rapidly worsening dyspnea. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive abnormal signal with involvement of the medulla oblongata. Since in our patient chest radiography failed to disclose a diaphragmatic palsy that is commonly observed in patients with phrenic nerve involvement, this acute manifestation of the disease may be attributed to brainstem involvement instead of cervical myelitis. Conclusion/clinical relevance: Clinicians should be aware of this atypical presentation of NMO, which needs to be promptly recognized and aggressively treated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Abstract Rationale: Bilateral brachial plexus block (BPB) generally requires a relatively large dose of local anesthetic for a successful block, resulting in a high risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. It can also result in inadvertent bilateral phrenic nerve palsy, leading to respiratory failure. Hence, it has not been widely used. However, it can be performed in selected patients. In this report, we present a case of ultrasound-guided BPB for bilateral upper extremity surgery in a patient with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Patient concerns: A 25-year-old woman with SCI secondary to traumatic fifth cervical spine fracture scheduled for surgical treatment of bilateral elbow fracture received bilateral BPB. Diagnoses: Due to the complications of SCI, the patient had incomplete sensory loss, loss of motor function, and complete diaphragmatic paralysis on the right side. Interventions: Right infraclavicular and left axillary BPB was performed as the sole anesthetic procedure for bilateral upper extremity surgery. Outcomes: Bilateral BPB was successful for bilateral upper extremity surgery. The surgery was uneventful and without further complications.

Recent findings Recent reports show positive outcomes on both unilateral and bilateral reinnervations. The phrenic nerve is the most commonly used donor for bilateral vocal palsy, but use of the superior laryngeal nerve has also been suggested. Summary Reinnervation of the larynx is a complex undertaking that can be performed by ENT surgeons with skills in microsurgery. Advances in this this field represent a paradigm shift in laryngeal rehabilitation and a prerequisite for laryngeal transplantation. Advances in basic understanding of nerve regeneration and in particular the need to surgically manage competitive reinnervation make the results of laryngeal reinnervation more predictable.   \n",

Electrophysiologic studies showed an acute motor axonal neuropathy. Serum anti‐GM1 IgG antibody was positive. Intavenous immunoglobulin treatment resulted in good clinical recovery. The present report indicates that the cranial and phrenic nerves may be affected unilaterally in Guillain–Barré syndrome, and that there is clinical variability in the axonal subtype of this syndrome. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

We report an unusual case of NMO relapse presenting with rapidly progressive respiratory failure and briefly discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this potential life-threatening complication of NMO. Findings: The 58-year-old woman with a history of bilateral optic neuritis presented to the emergency department with rapidly worsening dyspnea. Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive abnormal signal with involvement of the medulla oblongata. Since in our patient chest radiography failed to disclose a diaphragmatic palsy that is commonly observed in patients with phrenic nerve involvement, this acute manifestation of the disease may be attributed to brainstem involvement instead of cervical myelitis. Conclusion/clinical relevance: Clinicians should be aware of this atypical presentation of NMO, which needs to be promptly recognized and aggressively treated.   \n",
       "3  Abstract Rationale: Bilateral brachial plexus block (BPB) generally requires a relatively large dose of local anesthetic for a successful block, resulting in a high risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. It can also result in inadvertent bilateral phrenic nerve palsy, leading to respiratory failure. Hence, it has not been widely used. However, it can be performed in selected patients. In this report, we present a case of ultrasound-guided BPB for bilateral upper extremity surgery in a patient with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Patient concerns: A 25-year-old woman with SCI secondary to traumatic fifth cervical spine fracture scheduled for surgical treatment of bilateral elbow fracture received bilateral BPB. Diagnoses: Due to the complications of SCI, the patient had incomplete sensory loss, loss of motor function, and complete diaphragmatic paralysis on the right side. Interventions: Right infraclavicular and left axillary BPB was performed as the sole anesthetic procedure for bilateral upper extremity surgery. Outcomes: Bilateral BPB was successful for bilateral upper extremity surgery. The surgery was uneventful and without further complications. Lessons: Patients with cervical SCI have a high risk of respiratory complications. Bilateral BPB can be a suitable option for bilateral upper extremity surgery in selected patients. It is imperative to select an appropriate anesthetic technique that preserves respiratory function to minimize the potential risk of respiratory complications.   \n",
