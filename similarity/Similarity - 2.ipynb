      "Cerebral cortical intrinsic connectivity networks share topographically arranged functional connectivity with the cerebellum. However, the contribution of cerebellar nodes to distributed network organization and function remains poorly understood. In humans, we applied theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation, guided by subject-specific connectivity, to regions of the cerebellum to evaluate the functional relevance of connections between cerebellar and cerebral cortical nodes in different networks. We demonstrate that changing activity in the human lateral cerebellar Crus I/II modulates the cerebral default mode network, whereas vermal lobule VII stimulation influences the cerebral dorsal attention system. These results provide novel insights into the distributed, but anatomically specific, modulatory impact of cerebellar effects on large-scale neural network function.\n",
      "The human extrastriate visual cortex contains functionally distinct regions where neuronal populations exhibit signals that are selective for objects. How such regions might play a causal role in underpinning our ability to recognize objects across different viewpoints remains uncertain. Here, we tested whether two extrastriate areas, the lateral occipital (LO) region and occipital face area (OFA), contained neuronal populations that play a causal role in recognizing two‐dimensional shapes across different rotations. We used visual priming to modulate the rotation‐sensitive activity of neuronal populations in these areas. State‐dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied after the presentation of a shape and immediately before a subsequent probe shape to which participants had to respond. We found that TMS applied to both the LO region and OFA modulated rotation‐invariant shape priming but, whereas the LO region was modulated by TMS for small rotations, the OFA was modulated for larger rotations. Importantly, our results demonstrate that a node in the face‐sensitive network, the OFA, participates in causally relevant encoding of non‐face stimuli.\n",
      "Previous research has accumulated convincing evidence to show that the human cerebellum contributes to the short-term storage of verbal information, but its specific role in brain networks involved in phonological storage remains uncertain. In a randomized, crossover and sham-controlled design, we here combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied to the right cerebellum, with fMRI to investigate systematically the contribution of the human cerebellum to encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of verbal information. After anodal, but not cathodal, tDCS, we found a reduced item recognition capacity together with an attenuated neural signal from the right cerebellar lobule VIIb, specifically during the late encoding phase. Within this phase, tDCS furthermore affected task-associated functional connections between right cerebellar lobule VIIb and the posterior parietal cortex. These findings suggest that the right cerebellar lobule VIIb interacts with the posterior parietal cortex, specifically during the late stages of verbal encoding, when verbal information enters phonological storage.\n",
      "Working memory is central to human cognition, and intensive cognitive training has been shown to expand working memory capacity in a given domain. It remains unknown, however, how the neural systems that support working memory are altered through intensive training to enable the expansion of working memory capacity. We used fMRI to measure plasticity in activations associated with complex working memory before and after 20 days of training. Healthy young adults were randomly assigned to train on either a dual n-back working memory task or a demanding visuospatial attention task. Training resulted in substantial and task-specific expansion of dual n-back abilities accompanied by changes in the relationship between working memory load and activation. Training differentially affected activations in two large-scale frontoparietal networks thought to underlie working memory: the executive control network and the dorsal attention network. Activations in both networks linearly scaled with working memory load before training, but training dissociated the role of the two networks and eliminated this relationship in the executive control network. Load-dependent functional connectivity both within and between these two networks increased following training, and the magnitudes of increased connectivity were positively correlated with improvements in task performance.

Over the past few decades, the development of functional neuroimaging techniques and tools from graph theory, network science, and computational neuroscience have markedly expanded opportunities to study the intrinsic organization of brain activity. However, many current computational models are fundamentally limited by little to no explicit assessment of the brain’s interactions with external stimuli. To address this limitation, we propose a simple scheme that jointly estimates the intrinsic organization of brain activity and extrinsic stimuli. Specifically, we adopt a linear dynamical model (intrinsic activity) under unknown exogenous inputs (e.g., sensory stimuli), and jointly estimate the model parameters and exogenous inputs. First, we demonstrate the utility of this scheme by accurately estimating unknown external stimuli in a synthetic example. Next, we examine brain activity at rest and task for 99 subjects from the Human Connectome Project, and find significant task-related changes in the identified system, and task-related increases in the estimated external inputs showing high similarity to known task regressors. Finally, through detailed examination of fluctuations in the spatial distribution of the oscillatory modes of the estimated system during the resting state, we find an apparent non-stationarity in the profile of modes that span several brain regions including the visual and the dorsal attention systems. The results suggest that these brain structures display a time-varying relationship, or alternatively, receive non-stationary exogenous inputs that can lead to apparent system non-stationarities. Together, our embodied model of brain activity provides an avenue to gain deeper insight into the relationship between cortical functional dynamics and their drivers.\n"

      "Background: Oligoclonal bands represent intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and play an important role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Kappa free light chains (KFLC) are increasingly recognized as an additional biomarker for intrathecal Ig synthesis. However, there are limited data on KFLC in neurological diseases other than MS. Methods: This study, conducted at two centers, retrospectively enrolled 346 non-MS patients. A total of 182 patients were diagnosed with non-inflammatory and 84 with inflammatory neurological diseases other than MS. A further 80 patients were classified as symptomatic controls. Intrathecal KFLC production was determined using different approaches: KFLC index, Reiber’s diagram, Presslauer’s exponential curve, and Senel’s linear curve. Results: Matching results of oligoclonal bands and KFLC (Reiber’s diagram) were frequently observed (93%). The Reiber’s diagram for KFLC detected intrathecal KFLC synthesis in an additional 7% of the patient samples investigated (4% non-inflammatory; 3% inflammatory), which was not found by oligoclonal band detection. Conclusions: The determination of both biomarkers (KFLC and oligoclonal bands) is recommended for routine diagnosis and differentiation of non-inflammatory and inflammatory neurological diseases. Due to the high sensitivity and physiological considerations, the assessment of KFLC in the Reiber’s diagram should be preferred to other evaluation methods.\n",

      "Plasma phylloquinone (vitamin K1) concentration from non-fasted blood samples was examined by season, smoking status, socio-demographic factors and phylloquinone intake in a nationally representative sample of 1154 British individuals aged 19–64 years from the 2000–1 National Diet and Nutrition Survey. Geometric mean plasma phylloquinone concentration was 0·94 (95 % CI 0·88, 1·00) nmol/l, with 95 % of values in the range 0·10–8·72 nmol/l. Plasma phylloquinone concentrations of 530 men were significantly higher than those of 624 women (1·13 (95 % CI 1·04, 1·22) v. 0·81 (95 % CI 0·74, 0·88) nmol/l; P < 0·001), independent of other factors. Women aged 19–34 years had significantly lower plasma phylloquinone concentration than their older counterparts. Women were also found to have lower plasma phylloquinone concentrations during summer compared with winter and spring (each P < 0·01). In contrast, plasma phylloquinone concentration in men did not vary significantly by season or any of the socio-demographic or lifestyle factors. Plasma phylloquinone concentrations were positively correlated with phylloquinone intake in men and women (r 0·26 and 0·32 respectively; each P < 0·001). Overall, forward stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that 8 % of the variation in plasma phylloquinone concentration was explained by phylloquinone intake, with a further 10 % of its variation explained by plasma concentrations of γ-tocopherol (6 %) and retinyl palmitate (4 %). After adjustment for age and corresponding nutrient intakes, plasma phylloquinone concentration was significantly associated (each P < 0·01) with plasma concentrations of total and LDL-cholesterol, α- and γ-tocopherols, retinyl palmitate, β-carotene, lycopene and lutein plus zeaxanthin in men and women.\n",

      "ABSTRACT The cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) through activation of the transcription factor Stat3. However, the contribution of other ancillary pathways stimulated by LIF in ESCs, such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways, is less well understood. We show here that naive-type mouse ESCs express high levels of a novel effector of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. This effector is an isoform of the Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder protein 1) adaptor protein that lacks the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) membrane-binding domain. Although not essential for rapid unrestricted growth of ESCs under optimal conditions, the novel Gab1 variant (Gab1β) is required for LIF-mediated cell survival under conditions of limited nutrient availability. This enhanced survival is absolutely dependent upon a latent palmitoylation site that targets Gab1β directly to ESC membranes. These results show that constitutive association of Gab1 with membranes through a novel mechanism promotes LIF-dependent survival of murine ESCs in nutrient-poor conditions. Highlighted Article: Embryonic stem cells rely upon expression of a novel lipid-modified Gab1 adaptor protein to promote survival under nutrient-poor conditions.\n",

      "Abstract Background COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were shown to be highly efficacious in preventing the disease in randomized controlled trials; nonetheless, evidence on the real-world effectiveness of this vaccine is limited. Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. Methods This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider in Israel that were vaccinated with at least one dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with rt-PCR, between 7 to 27 days after second dose (protection-period), as compared to days 1 to 7 after the first dose, where no protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). Results Data of 1,178,597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years [SD=18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872,454 (74.0%) reached the protection period. Overall, 4514 infections occurred during the reference period compared to 728 during the protection period, yielding a weighted mean daily incidence of 54.8 per 100,000 (95%CI: 26.1-115.0 per 100,000) and 5.4 per 100,000 (95%CI: 3.5-8.4 per 100,000), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was 90% (95%CI:79%- 95%) and 94% (95%CI:88%-97%) against COVID-19. Among immunosuppressed patients, vaccine effectiveness against infection was 71% (95%CI:37%-87%). The adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization in those infected were 0.82 (95%CI:0.36-1.88), 0.45 (95%CI:0.23-0.90), and 0.56 (95%CI:0.36-0.89) in the age groups 16-44, 45-64 and 75 and above, respectively. Conclusions The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine is comparable to the one reported in the phase III clinical trial.\n",

      "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in diverse roles in breast cancer development and progression. While many of the different MMPs expressed in breast cancer are produced by stromal cells MMP-9 is produced mainly by the tumor cells themselves. To date, the functional role of tumor cell-produced MMP-9 has remained unclear. Here, we show that human breast cancer cell-produced MMP-9 is specifically required for invasion in cell culture and for pulmonary metastasis in a mouse orthotopic model of basal-like breast cancer. We also find that tumor cell-produced MMP-9 promotes tumor vascularization with only modest impact on primary tumor growth, and that silencing of MMP-9 expression in tumor cells leads to an altered transcriptional program consistent with reversion to a less malignant phenotype. MMP-9 is most highly expressed in human basal-like and triple negative tumors, where our data suggest that it contributes to metastatic progression. Our results suggest that MMP9 may offer a target for anti-metastatic therapies for basal-like triple negative breast cancers, a poor prognosis subtype with few available molecularly targeted therapeutic options.\n",

      "CONSCIOUSNESS AND ACTION CONTROL It was Sigmund Freud who put the relative contributions from conscious and unconscious processes to the control of human action on the psychological agenda. Freud (1949) suggested that action control emerges from the interplay between unconscious, automatic, and reward-oriented action tendencies generated by the Id and rational, socially mediated considerations provided by the Ego. While Id processes were assumed to be inaccessible for consciousness in principle, some, but not all Ego operations were claimed to be conscious. This basic logic still provides the blueprint for our current theorizing about action control. Indeed, numerous “dual-route” models in almost all psychological and cognitiveneuroscientific research areas assume that human action emerges from the interplay between consciously inaccessible automatic action tendencies and consciously accessible top-down processes that enforce intentional action goals and social acceptability [for an overview, see Evans and Stanovich (2013)]. Interestingly, many authors associate conscious accessibility with cognitive control (Hommel, 2007). For instance, in the action-control model of Norman and Shallice (1986), automatic, stimulus-driven actions are contrasted with actions that are under “deliberate conscious control,” as if unconscious deliberate control would be inconceivable. In the same spirit, Libet (1985) has suggested that consciousness might have a “veto” that prevents unwanted actions from execution. In the following, I will argue that there is no evidence that consciousness plays a causal or decisive role in action control, so that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is necessary or useful for the control of human actions. EXECUTIVE IGNORANCE If agents would control their actions through the having of conscious experiences, they should be able to report how and based on what information they are exerting such control. However, agents know surprisingly little about their actions (Wegner, 2002). As James (1890, p. 499) put it: “we are only conversant with the outward results of our volition, and not with the hidden inner machinery of nerves and muscles which are what it primarily sets it at work”—a kind of executive ignorance (Turvey, 1977). Numerous examples show that actions can be parameterized and redirected by stimuli that the agent is unable to consciously perceive because of subliminal presentation or lesions in higher perceptual areas [e.g., Prablanc and Pelisson, 1990; for overviews, see Glover (2004); Milner and Goodale, 1995]. Agents can be easily fooled into experiencing artificial effectors as being a part of their own body (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998) and perceiving actions of other people as being carried out by themselves, or vice versa (e.g., Nielsen, 1963). But even higher-level executive-control operations can be triggered by stimuli the conscious perception of which is prevented by masking procedures [for overviews, see van Gaal et al. (2012); Kunde et al., 2012]. Among other things, this holds for the implementation of a task set (Reuss et al., 2011) and the stopping of the planned action (van Gaal et al., 2010), suggesting that executive control does not rely on consciousness. Indeed, there is widespread agreement that generating a conscious experience takes time, at least 300-500milliseconds (e.g., Libet, 2004; Dehaene et al., 2006), which would be way too slow for many everyday actions and most reactions in cognitive-psychological tasks. Hence, not only is our conscious knowledge about action control severely limited, it is also difficult to see at which point in time the application of this knowledge would be useful. One way to save a role for consciousness and action control would be to relate it to the translation of intentions into more specific action plans. Consider, for instance, the seminal study of Libet et al. (1982), who observed that the physiological indicators of action preparation preceded the agent’s conscious urge to act by hundreds of milliseconds. Even though this might be taken against a causal role of conscious experience in the online-generation of actions (Wegner, 2002), it does not rule out such a role in translating instructions into a general action plan at the beginning of the study. Indeed, several authors since Exner (1879) have considered that implementing such a plan delegates control to internal and external stimuli, which might very well operate outside of consciousness (Bargh, 1989; Hommel, 2000). And yet, this would leave a severely limited role of consciousness that is restricted to off-line control. Moreover, it has been claimed that integrating information from and across different informational maps and systems require conscious experience (Baars, 1988) and one might argue that preparatory off-line action planning involves such kind of cross-domain integration. However, recent demonstrations that neither the integration of multimodal event features (Zmigrod and Hommel, 2011) nor the integration of objects with their background (Mudrik et al., 2011) depend on consciousness do not support this possibility.\n",

      "Abstract Background: While early antimicrobial treatment is of critical importance to patients with severe infections, excessive use of antibiotics has caused escalating bacterial resistance. Better diagnostic tools are needed to secure antibiotic stewardship. Methods: The diagnostic value of clinical and laboratory variables in predicting infections that require antibiotic treatment was evaluated in a prospective observational study of 404 adult patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) with suspected severe infections. We also investigated the association of these variables with bacteraemia and severe sepsis. Results: In a univariate analysis, increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin 6 (IL-6), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils, respiratory rate (RR) (p ≤ 0.001), and a decreased haemoglobin (Hb) level (p = 0.005) were associated with an indicated demand for antibiotics (n = 286). In a multivariate analysis, only WBC, Hb, RR, and CRP remained independent predictors. When compared to the clinician's ability to make accurate antibiotic decisions, all variables tested had inferior diagnostic accuracy except CRP. Increased levels of PCT, IL-6, LBP, CRP, bilirubin, and RR were significantly associated with bacteraemia (n = 68) (p ≤ 0.001). Of these, PCT and IL-6 were also associated with severe sepsis (n = 156) (p < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, CRP, RR, PCT, and bilirubin remained associated with bacteraemia. Conclusions: Special attention should be directed to CRP, WBC, RR, and Hb when selecting patients for antibiotic treatment in the emergency department. PCT, IL-6, and LBP did not provide additional guidance on antibiotic decisions and better tests are required in order to improve antibiotic stewardship.\n",

      "We investigate the structure and dynamics of proton solvation structures in mixed water/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvents using two-color mid-infrared femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy. At a water fraction below 20%, protons are mainly solvated as (DMSO-H)+ and (DMSO-H)+-H2O structures. We find that excitation of the OH-stretch vibration of the proton in (DMSO-H)+-H2O structures leads to an ultrafast contraction of the hydrogen bond between (DMSO-H)+ and H2O. This excited state relaxes rapidly with T1 = 95 ± 10 fs and leads in part to a strong local heating effect and in part to predissociation of the protonated cluster into (DMSO-H)+ and water monomers.\n",

      "Purpose: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is key to tumor angiogenesis and is an important target in the development of anticancer drugs. However, VEGF receptor (VEGFR) expression in human cancers, particularly the relative expression of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 in tumor vasculature versus tumor cells, is poorly defined. Experimental Design: VEGFR-2– and VEGFR-3–specific antibodies were identified and used in the immunohistochemical analysis of human primary cancers and normal tissue. The relative vascular localization of both receptors in colorectal and breast cancers was determined by coimmunofluorescence with vascular markers. Results: VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 were expressed on vascular endothelium but not on malignant cells in 13 common human solid tumor types (n > 400, bladder, breast, colorectal, head and neck, liver, lung, skin, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, stomach, and thyroid). The signal intensity of both receptors was significantly greater in vessels associated with malignant colorectal, lung, and breast than adjacent nontumor tissue. In colorectal cancers, VEGFR-2 was expressed on both intratumoral blood and lymphatic vessels, whereas VEGFR-3 was found predominantly on lymphatic vessels. In breast cancers, both receptors were localized to and upregulated on blood vessels. Conclusions: VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 are primarily localized to, and significantly upregulated on, tumor vasculature (blood and/or lymphatic) supporting the majority of solid cancers. The primary clinical mechanism of action of VEGF signaling inhibitors is likely to be through the targeting of tumor vessels rather than tumor cells. The upregulation of VEGFR-3 on tumor blood vessels indicates a potential additional antiangiogenic effect for dual VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3–targeted therapy. Clin Cancer Res; 16(14); 3548–61. ©2010 AACR.\n",

      "Loss of pancreatic β‐cells in type I diabetes is associated with an increase in T helper 1 (Th1) proinflammatory cytokines in the islet milieu, with a concomitant reduction in Th2 anti‐inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, manoeuvres designed to polarize Th1 responses towards Th2, particularly involving interleukin (IL)‐4, have been shown to protect against insulitis and diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether IL‐4 can exert a direct effect on β‐cell viability. The rat pancreatic β‐cell line, BRIN‐BD11, was used. IL‐4R mRNA expression was assayed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing and protein expression measured using anti‐IL‐4R antibodies and confocal microscopy. Cells were pretreated in vitro with IL‐4, incubated with IL‐1β and interferon (IFN)‐γ and DNA fragmentation and nitrite production analysed by flow cytometry and Griess assay, respectively. Expression of type I (IL‐4R alpha and common γ‐chain) and type II (IL‐4R alpha, IL‐13R alpha‐1) IL‐4R mRNA transcripts, together with cell surface expression of IL‐4R, was demonstrated. Pre‐incubation with IL‐4 reduced significantly cell death induced by IL‐1β alone or by a combination of IL‐1β and IFN‐γ, although this was not accompanied by a reduced production of nitrite. The protective effect of IL‐4 was not seen when all three cytokines were added simultaneously. These results demonstrate, for the first time, expression of IL‐4 receptor components on rat pancreatic β‐cells and reveal a direct protective effect on the loss of viability mediated by proinflammatory cytokines when β‐cells are pre‐incubated with IL‐4.\n",

      "Objective Menstrual symptoms such as dysmenorrhea usually occur during the hormone-free interval in oral contraceptive users. Progestin withdrawal activates NF-κB transcription factor, which upregulates both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Cox-2 expression in the endometrium. The use of natural NF-κB inhibitors such as pycnogenol may block this response, improving dysmenorrhea. Patients and methods Twenty-four patients with severe dysmenorrhea were allocated to one of two treatment groups. In Group A (n=13), women were treated with an oral contraceptive containing 15 μg of ethinyl estradiol and 60 mg of gestodene (Adoless®) in a 24/4 regimen for three consecutive cycles. Women in Group B (n=11) used the same contraceptive regimen together with 100 mg of pycnogenol (Flebon®) continuously for 3 months. Pain scores were graded using a visual analog scale (VAS) before and during the hormone-free interval at the end of the third treatment cycle. Results Before treatment, VAS pain scores for dysmenorrhea were 8 and 9 in Groups A and B, respectively. However, by the end of the third treatment cycle, pain scores had decreased significantly (P<0.05) both in groups A and B. The final pain scores were 6 in Group A and 2 in Group B, a difference that was statistically significant (P<0.0001). In Group B, 27% of the patients became pain-free, while in Group A, none of the women reported complete disappearance of this symptom. The number of bleeding days was also lower in Group B. Discussion Pycnogenol effectively decreased pain scores and the number of bleeding days when administered concomitantly with a low-dose 24/4 oral contraceptive containing gestodene.\n",

      "Context: Accumulated moderate physical activity (PA) for 30 min in a day is the only recommended treatment of prehypertension. Objective: We investigated autonomic modulation as a possible mechanism for the decrease in blood pressure (BP) during the rest periods in each 10 min session of PA. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a single-blind randomized multi-arm control trial on 40 prehypertensive (pre-HT) young male adults. Methods: Participants were randomly divided by using random number table into four groups. Control (no intervention); Group 1 (walking at 50% of predicted VO2 peak); Group 2 (walking at 60% of predicted VO2 peak); Group 3 (walking at 70% of predicted VO2 peak). BP, heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate recovery 1 min (HRR 1 min) were measured at baseline and during the rest period after each session of 10 min over 30 min of accumulated physical activity (PAcumm). Results: Significant diastolic BP (DBP) reduction (P < 0.001) was observed during the rest period after each session of PAcumm in intervention groups. An average reduction in DBP was more in pre-HT undertaking PAcumm at 70% of predicted VO2 Peak. Decrease in the mean value of low-frequency (LF) and LF/high-frequency ratio was observed following PAcumm in all intervention groups irrespective of the intensity of PA. No significant association of reduction of BP with HRV and HRR 1 s was observed. Conclusion: Reduction in BP was observed during the rest period after each 10 min session of PAcumm irrespective of the intensity of PA. Autonomic modulation does not seem to be the possible mechanism for the reduction in BP during the sessions.\n",

      "Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common form of hereditary optic neuropathy. DOA presents in the first decade of life and manifests as progressive vision loss. In DOA retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve degenerate by an unknown mechanism. The gene mutated in DOA, Optic Atrophy Type 1 (OPA1), encodes a dynamin‐related GTPase implicated in mitochondrial fusion and maintenance of the mitochondrial network and genome. Here, we determine which cell types in the normal retina and the optic nerve express OPA1. In the normal rat retina, OPA1 is expressed in the ganglion cell layer as well as in the outer plexiform layer, the inner nuclear layer, and the inner plexiform layer. In the ganglion cell layer, OPA1 is expressed predominantly in retinal ganglion cells. By contrast, OPA1 protein is low or undetectable in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes of the optic nerve. Additionally, OPA1 protein is present in axonal mitochondria. Last, OPA1 expression is present in mitochondria of processes and cell bodies of purified retinal ganglion cells and of the RGC‐5 cell line. Thus, OPA1 is predominantly expressed in retinal ganglion cells of the normal rat retina and axons of the optic nerve. These findings may explain the selective vulnerability of retinal ganglion cells to OPA1 loss of function. J. Comp. Neurol. 488:1–10, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\n",

Sarcomatoid cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) is an extremely rare liver primary tumour. Here, we report a case of an elderly man who was admitted to our hospital after head trauma. He performed a head CT that diagnosed cerebral metastasis. On abdominal CT, he presented a 10×8×9 cm-sized hypodense liver mass in the VII and VIII segments, with peripheral enhancement. Histological and immunohistochemical examination of the tumour showed a malignant neoplasm with both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components and positive expression of cytokeratin and vimentin antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with intrahepatic sarcomatoid CCC at an advanced stage and died 45 days after the diagnosis.

      "The VS nucleolytic ribozyme has a core comprising five helices organized by two three‐way junctions. The ribozyme can act in trans on a hairpin‐loop substrate, with which it interacts via tertiary contacts. We have determined that one of the junctions (2‐3‐6) undergoes two‐stage ion‐dependent folding into a stable conformation, and have determined the global structure of the folded junction using long‐range distance restraints derived from fluorescence resonance energy transfer. A number of sequence variants in the junction are severely impaired in ribozyme cleavage, and there is good correlation between changes in activity and alteration in the folding of junction 2‐3‐6. These studies point to a special importance of G and A nucleotides immediately adjacent to helix II, and comparison with a similar junction of known structure indicates that this could adopt a guanine‐wedge structure. We propose that the 2‐3‐6 junction organizes important aspects of the structure of the ribozyme to facilitate productive association with the substrate, and suggest that this results in an interaction between the substrate and the A730 loop to create the active complex.\n",

      "Although clinicians and researchers often rely on family members' reports of a wide range of dying patients' symptoms and care preferences, available data indicate divergences between the two. We used a national sample to analyze patient-caregiver pairs to explore areas of concordance and nonconcordance about physical symptoms, communication with physicians, caregiving needs, andfuturefears. We also assessed whether identifiable patient or caregiver characteristics were associated with nonconcordance. Our data were from a national, random sample of 988 terminally ill patients, of whom 893 had caregivers who were also interviewed. Frequencies and types of nonconcordance were computed for patient-caregiverpairs. Bivariate associations between patient and caregiver reports on each item were tested Logistic and conditional logistic regression analyses assessed multiple predictors of nonconcordance for each item. Primary diagnoses included cancer (51.1 percent), heart disease (17. 7 percent), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (10. 7percent), and other diseases (20.5 percent). The proportion of concordant reports among pairs ofpatients and caregivers ranged from 53 percent to 66 percent. Among pairs showing nonconcordant responses, caregivers reported higher levels of pain and disability than patients, lower caregiving needs, and different fears about thefuture. Few demographic or clinical predictors were associated with nonconcordance. Concordance between patients' and their caregivers' responses ranged widely, and there were important areas of nonconcordant responses. When responses differed, patients were more likely to express concern about domains that might impose on caregivers, while caregivers were more likely to express concern about patients' physical suffering. Consistent sociodemographic or clinical predictors of nonconcordant responses were not found These data suggest important ways that patient and caregiver reports of the samg e experience vary.\n",

      "Fluoroquinolones (FQLs) are synthetic antibacterial agents containing a 4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline skeleton. When concomintantly administered with other drugs which may contain metal ions, particularly Al3+ (antacids, phosphate binders, vaccines etc.) they may form metal–drug complexes. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that aluminium–quinolone interactions lead to reduced bio-availability and altered activity of the drug with possible development of the toxic effects of aluminium ion. Reliable speciation in Al3+–quinolone systems at the micromolar concentration level is needed to better understand pharmaco- and toxico-kinetics of the FQLs in the presence of Al. In this work, the speciation in solutions containing Al3+ and FQL family members (fleroxacin, moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was studied by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), ESI-tandem mass spectrometry and laser desorption ionisation (LDI) MS. The dominating species identified in all three Al3+–FQL solutions, at approx. 30–50 μmol L−1 total Al concentration and 2:1 to 1:3 metal-to-ligand ratio in the pH range 3.0–6.0, were the ions related to the complexes AlL2+, AlL2+ and AlL30 (L = ligand in the mono-deprotonated form). Mixed protonated and hydroxo complexes were also formed at lower and higher pH values, respectively and, as expected, dimeric and polymeric species were not observed in ESI spectra. LDI measurements confirmed the existence of the mononuclear complexes found by ESI and indicated the formation of polymeric species. The ion [2Al3+ + 5L−]+ was identified with all three FQLs. This ionic species most probably arises from Al2L2 by clustering with free ligand anions. Comparison of literature potentiometric data with mass spectral data indicated good agreement between speciation schemes. The results obtained suggest the presence of strong interaction between FQLs and Al3+, which may be important in affecting absorption of these drugs in the gastrointestinal tract.\n",

      "Constraint-based metabolic modeling such as flux balance analysis (FBA) has been widely used to simulate cell metabolism. Thanks to its simplicity and flexibility, numerous algorithms have been developed based on FBA and successfully predicted the phenotypes of various biological systems. However, their phenotype predictions may not always be accurate in FBA because of using the objective function that is assumed for cell metabolism. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a novel computational framework, namely omFBA, to integrate multi-omics data (e.g. transcriptomics) into FBA to obtain omics-guided objective functions with high accuracy. In general, we first collected transcriptomics data and phenotype data from published database (e.g. GEO database) for different microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We then developed a “Phenotype Match” algorithm to derive an objective function for FBA that could lead to the most accurate estimation of the known phenotype (e.g. ethanol yield). The derived objective function was next correlated with the transcriptomics data via regression analysis to generate the omics-guided objective function, which was next used to accurately simulate cell metabolism at unknown conditions. We have applied omFBA in studying sugar metabolism of S. cerevisiae and found that the ethanol yield could be accurately predicted in most of the cases tested (>80%) by using transcriptomics data alone, and revealed valuable metabolic insights such as the dynamics of flux ratios. Overall, omFBA presents a novel platform to potentially integrate multi-omics data simultaneously and could be incorporated with other FBA-derived tools by replacing the arbitrary objective function with the omics-guided objective functions.\n",

      "The role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione (GSH) precursor, was investigated in protection against isoniazid-(INH) and rifampicin-(RIF) induced oxidative hepatic injury in young Wistar rats. The hepatotoxic dose of INH and RIF was 50 mg kg-1 day-1 each and the hepatoprotective dose of NAC was 100 mg kgday-. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in sterile water (4.0 ml kg-1 day-1) over a period of 3 weeks. Status of oxidative/antioxidative profiles was the mechanistic approach to assess the hepatotoxicity and/or hepatoprotection. The oxidative injury in INH-RIF co-exposed animals was closely associated with significant decline of GSH and related thiols, as well as with compromised antioxidant enzyme system. The oxidative stress was further supported by increased lipid peroxidation observed in these animals. The co-administration of NAC prevented the induction of oxidative stress in INH-RIF co-exposed animals. The amelioration of oxidative stress by NAC was faithfully reflected as normal morphology in these animals, except the presence of mild degree of portal triaditis in one animal co-exposed to INH-RIF and NAC. In contrast, the animals co-exposed to INH-RIF alone showed histological lesions which ranged from intralobular inflammation to patchy necrosis. These results suggest that INH-RIF-induced oxidative injury can be prevented by supporting the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism by NAC.\n",

      "O6‐Methylguanine‐DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a major determinant of resistance to temozolomide. Its levels are depleted in lymphocytes after drug administration, but there is partial recovery by 24 hr, the usual time of subsequent dosing. Administering subsequent doses of temozolomide at the MGMT nadir could enhance its effectiveness, by increasing the amount of O6‐methylguanine (O6‐meG) in DNA. We evaluated the efficacy of such a schedule of temozolomide and determined the kinetics of MGMT depletion and O6‐meG formation in DNA following treatment. Thirty patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated with temozolomide 1,000 mg/m2 equally split into 5 doses over a 16 hr period every 28 days. O6‐meG formation was determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA and, in a subset of patients, in tumor tissue during the first treatment cycle. MGMT levels fell rapidly with dosing, reaching a nadir in PBMCs of 18.0 ± 2.26% of initial levels. O6‐meG levels increased during the treatment period, peaking at 11.1 ± 1.25 μmol/mol dG in PBMCs and at 4.25 ± 0.79 μmol/mol dG in tumor biopsies. The main toxicities were grade IV thrombocytopenia in 12 patients (42.8%) and grade IV neutropenia in 11 patients (39.2%), associated with fever in 8 cases. There were 7 responses (1 complete), for an overall response rate of 23.3%; median overall survival was 6.1 months. The compressed schedule has activity against melanoma, with greater MGMT depletion and O6‐meG formation than previously reported for O6‐alkylating agent regimens. Myelosuppression precludes its wider application, but MGMT in PBMCs predicted the dose intensity of temozolomide that patients could sustain, suggesting a means by which individuals suitable for this approach might be identified.

Using a between-group design, we tested whether participants perception of African American models wearing sweatpants and sweatshirts (“swagger”), clothing showing they won an event, or formal clothing, would vary. Participants (N = 143) viewed four African American models in one of three conditions. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) with Symbolic Racism Scale scores as a covariate revealed that participants rated models in Formal clothing significantly higher than models in winning clothing in intelligence, p <.001, trustworthiness, p <.001, and warmth p =.005. Models wearing formal clothing or winning clothing were also rated significantly higher than models wearing swagger clothing on several traits. Participant’s Symbolic Racism Score significantly affected their ratings of models. Results suggest that the clothing that an African American wears, as well as viewer prejudice, affects the impression that the viewer makes.\n",

      "How a living organism maintains its healthy equilibrium in response to endless exposure of potentially harmful chemicals is an important question in current biology. By transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish livers treated by various chemicals, we defined hubs as molecular pathways that are frequently perturbed by chemicals and have high degree of functional connectivity to other pathways. Our network analysis revealed that these hubs were organized into two groups showing inverted functionality with each other. Intriguingly, the inverted activity profiles in these two groups of hubs were observed to associate only with toxicopathological states but not with physiological changes. Furthermore, these inverted profiles were also present in rat, mouse, and human under certain toxicopathological conditions. Thus, toxicopathological-associated anti-correlated profiles in hubs not only indicate their potential use in diagnosis but also development of systems-based therapeutics to modulate gene expression by chemical approach in order to rewire the deregulated activities of hubs back to normal physiology.\n",

      "Toll-like receptors (TLR) are receptors of innate immunity that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns. They play a critical role in many pathological states, in acute and chronic inflammatory processes. TLR9 is a promising target for drug discovery, since it has been implicated in several pathologies, including defense against viral infections and psoriasis. Immune-modulators are promising molecules for therapeutic intervention in these indications. TLR9 is located in the endosome and activated by dsDNA with CpG motives encountered in microbial DNA. Here we report on a combined approach to discover new TLR9 antagonists by computational chemistry and cell based assays. We used our in-house iterative stochastic elimination (ISE) algorithm to create models that distinguish between TLR9 antagonists (\"actives\") and other molecules (\"inactives\"), based on molecular physicochemical properties. Subsequent screening and scoring of a data set of 1.8 million commercially available molecules led to the purchasing of top scored molecules, which were tested in a new cell based system based on human pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) stably expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. As described previously, this cell line shows a very low endogenous PRR-activity and contains a reporter gene which is selectively activated by the integrated human PRR enabling rapid screening of potential ligands. IC50 values of each of these top scored molecules were determined. Out of 60 molecules tested, 56 showed antagonistic activity. We discovered 21 new highly potential antagonists with IC50 values lower than 10 μM, with 5 of them having IC50 values under 1 μM.\n",

      "Background: In bone tissue engineering, poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles are frequently used as a delivery vehicle for bioactive molecules. Calcium phosphate cement is an injectable, osteoconductive, and degradable bone cement that sets in situ. The objective of this study was to create an injectable composite based on calcium phosphate cement embedded with PLGA microparticles for sustained delivery of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2).Methods: 125 I-labeled rhBMP-2 was incorporated in PLGA microparticles. PLGA microparticle/calcium-phosphate cement composites were prepared in a ratio of 30:70 by weight. Material properties were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, microcomputed tomography, and mechanical testing. Release kinetics of rhBMP-2 from PLGA/calcium-phosphate cement disks and PLGA microparticles alone were determined in vitro in two buffer solutions (pH 7.4 and pH 4.0) for up to twenty-eight days.Results: The entrapment yield of rhBMP-2 in PLGA microparticles was a mean (and standard deviation) of 79% ± 8%. Analysis showed spherical PLGA microparticles (average size, 17.2 ±1.3 &mgr;m) distributed homogeneously throughout the nanoporous disks. The average compressive strength was significantly lower (p < 0.001) for PLGA and calcium-phosphate cement composite scaffolds than for calcium-phosphate cement scaffolds alone (6.4 ± 0.6 MPa compared with 38.6 ± 2.6 MPa, respectively). Average rhBMP-2 loading was 5.0 ± 0.4 &mgr;g per 75-mm 3 disk. Release of rhBMP-2 was limited for all formulations. At pH 7.4, 3.1% ± 0.1% of the rhBMP-2 was released from the PLGA/calcium-phosphate cement disks and 18.0% ± 1.9% was released from the PLGA microparticles alone after twenty-eight days. At pH 4.0, PLGA/calcium-phosphate cement disks revealed more release of rhBMP-2 than did PLGA microparticles alone (14.5% ± 6.3% compared with 5.4% ± 0.7%) by day 28.Conclusions: These results indicate that preparation of a PLGA/calcium-phosphate cement composite for the delivery of rhBMP-2 is feasible and that the release of rhBMP-2 is dependent on the composite composition and nanostructure as well as the pH of the release medium.Clinical Relevance: An osteoconductive and osteoinductive rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/calcium-phosphate cement composite may potentially result in an injectable bone-graft substitute for the regeneration of bone in ectopic or orthotopic sites.\n",

      "PURPOSE: Dietary adherence can be challenging for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), as they may require multiple dietary changes. Choosing appropriate food items may be difficult or take extensive amounts of time without the aid of technology. The objective of this project was to (1) examine the dietary challenges faced by patients with CHD, (2) examine methods of coping with dietary challenges, (3) explore the feasibility of a Web-based food decision support system, and (4) explore the feasibility of a mobile-based food decision support system. METHODS: Food for the Heart (FFH), a Web site–based food decision support system, and Mobile Magic Lens (MML), a mobile-based system, were developed to aid in daily dietary choices. Three CHD patient focus groups were conducted and focused on CHD-associated dietary changes as well as the FFH and MML prototypes. A total of 20 CHD patients and 7 informal caregivers participated. Qualitative, content analysis was performed to find themes grounded in the responses. RESULTS: Five predominant themes emerged: (1) decreasing carbohydrate intake and portion control are common dietary challenges, (2) clinician and social support makes dietary adherence easier, (3) FFH could make meal-planning and dietary adherence less complicated, (4) MML could save time and assist with healthy choices, and (5) additional features need to be added to make both tools more comprehensive. CONCLUSION: Food for the Heart and MML may be tools that CHD patients would value in making food choices and adhering to dietary recommendations, especially if additional features are added to assist patients with changes.\n",

      "Bioengineering of skeletal muscle in vitro in order to produce highly aligned myofibres in relevant three dimensional (3D) matrices have allowed scientists to model the in vivo skeletal muscle niche. This review discusses essential experimental considerations for developing bioengineered muscle in order to investigate exercise mimicking stimuli. We identify current knowledge for the use of electrical stimulation and co‐culture with motor neurons to enhance skeletal muscle maturation and contractile function in bioengineered systems in vitro. Importantly, we provide a current opinion on the use of acute and chronic exercise mimicking stimuli (electrical stimulation and mechanical overload) and the subsequent mechanisms underlying physiological adaptation in 3D bioengineered muscle. We also identify that future studies using the latest bioreactor technology, providing simultaneous electrical and mechanical loading and flow perfusion in vitro, may provide the basis for advancing knowledge in the future. We also envisage, that more studies using genetic, pharmacological, and hormonal modifications applied in human 3D bioengineered skeletal muscle may allow for an enhanced discovery of the in‐depth mechanisms underlying the response to exercise in relevant human testing systems. Finally, 3D bioengineered skeletal muscle may provide an opportunity to be used as a pre‐clinical in vitro test‐bed to investigate the mechanisms underlying catabolic disease, while modelling disease itself via the use of cells derived from human patients without exposing animals or humans (in phase I trials) to the side effects of potential therapies.\n",

      "An increasing number of myocarditis/pericarditis incidences has been reported after coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccination in adolescents and young adults. This study was designed to investigate the incidence rate of—and risk for—myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination in the United States according to age and vaccine type. This study used the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) from 11 December 2020 to 13 August 2021. A population-based data mining approach was performed based on the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Adverse events of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination were rare, with an incidence rate of 5.98 (95% CI = 5.73–6.24) cases per million doses administered. The incidence rate was higher in adolescents and after the administration of the second dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. Overall, two mRNA vaccines were significantly associated with increased risks for myocarditis/pericarditis (mRNA-1273 (Moderna): ROR = 2.91, 95% CI = 2.21–3.83; BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech): ROR = 5.37, 95% CI = 4.10–7.04) compared to all other vaccines from VAERS. The viral vector vaccine of Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) was not associated with signals of myocarditis/pericarditis (ROR = 1.39; 95% CI = 0.99–1.97). This study found increased risks for myocarditis/pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. For patients at high risk for myocarditis/pericarditis or with myocardial injuries, the viral vector vaccine may be an alternative for consideration.\n",

      "adequate oxygenation for as long as 15 minutes if Boyle's machine and an endotracheal tube are not immediately available (Mozen et al., 1956; Nickel and Gale, 1959). An emergency thoracotomy is much easier to perform than, say, an emergency tracheostomy, and once cardiac massage has been started and an airway established expert anaesthetic and surgical assistance can be awaited in comparative leisure. Looking back on this case, we are aware that it was mismanaged in several ways, partly through ignorance and partly through lack of thought at the time. The heart was massaged incorrectly, against the ball of the thumb instead of against the chest wall or thenar eminence; the foot of the couch was not raised to aid cerebral blood flow; procainamide or quinidine should have been administered rather than digitalis; neither blood nor saline should have been given in view of the risk of cerebral oedema; and too large doses of pethidine and phenothiazine derivatives were given in the immediate post-operative period. Yet, in spite of these errors, in spite of a previous transmural infarct, and in spite of 40 minutes of cardiac massage with no detectable pulse, the patient survived, and survived, moreover, without apparent cerebral damage. This would suggest that cardiac massage does not demand ideal circumstances and expert knowledge to be successful, and reinforces our belief that it should become the accepted treatment in hospital practice of cardiac arrest after myocardial infarction in reasonably young and fit patients.\n",

      "Objective This study aimed to analyse the prevalence and factors associated with continuum of maternal healthcare services among women who gave birth in Siyadebirena Wayu district, Central Ethiopia. Design Community-based cross-sectional study. Setting At eight Kebeles in Central Ethiopia. Participants The study was done on 614 women aged 15–49 years using interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Following proportional allocation of the sample, we used simple random sampling technique to select study participants. Methods Binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify the factors associated with the outcome. Variables with p<0.2 in the bivariable analysis were the candidates for multivariable analysis. A p<0.05 and adjusted OR (AOR) with 95% CI were taken to declare the factors and the strengths of association with continuum of maternal healthcare utilisation. Outcome Continuum of maternal healthcare utilisation. Results Only 16.1% (95% CI 13.3% to 19.0%) of the women had used a complete continuum of maternal health services. Variables, such as contraceptive use (AOR 4.95; 95% CI 1.61 to 15.20), autonomy (AOR 4.45; 95% CI 1.69 to 11.60), urban residence (AOR 3.91; 95% CI 1.06 to 14.39), educated women (AOR 5.36; 95% CI 1.15 to 25.06), took less than 30 min to reach a health facility (AOR 3.17; 95% CI 1.38 to 7.25), use public transportation (AOR 2.48; 95% CI 1.12 to 5.52) and good knowledge (AOR 9.88; 95% CI 3.89 to 25.0) were positively associated with continuum of maternal healthcare. In the contrary, women who had third child birth order (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.8) was negatively associated. Conclusions Overall, the level of the continuum of maternal healthcare services utilisation was low compared with the national and global targets. Therefore, programme planners and implementer had better conduct health education to enhance the awareness of women about continuum of maternal healthcare services. Healthcare sector policy-makers and managers shall also scale up healthcare facilities to improve access to maternal healthcare services.\n",

      "Background Food insecurity and poverty rates in Ghana are highest in the districts from latitude 8° N upwards. These have motivated several interventions aimed at addressing the food insecurity via promoting agricultural growth. An assessment of the overall impact of these interventions on food security is necessary to guide policy design and future interventions. Methods and findings A systematic review was used to assess the cumulative evidence of the effect of development interventions, implemented from 2006 to 2016 on food security, especially in Northern Ghana. Information were retrieved from over 20 Government and non-Governmental organisations through online search and actual visits. The number of studies included in systematic review was 22. The study showed that a large number of interventions have been implemented in Northern Ghana over the study period. Access to quality extension services, training and capacity building was a major intervention strategy. About 82% of studies considered increasing production but only 14% of the studies reported on changes in yield. About 42% of the included studies used market access as a strategy but about 44% reported increase in incomes of beneficiaries (with only seven studies providing numerical evidence for this claim). The ranking of frequency of intervention strategies was in the order extension and capacity building > production > postharvest value addition > water and irrigation facilities > storage facilities > input supply. A substantial number of the studies had no counterfactuals, weakening confidence in attributing impacts on food security for even the beneficiaries. Conclusions It is concluded that evidence for impacts of the interventions on food security was weak, or largely assumed. A logical recommendation is the need for development partners to synchronise their measurement and indicators of food security outcomes. It is also recommended that some food security indicators are explicitly incorporated into intervention design while bearing in mind the potential need for counterfactuals.\n",

      "Research on animal microbiomes is increasingly aimed at determining the evolutionary and ecological factors that govern host–microbiome dynamics, which are invariably intertwined and potentially synergistic. We present three empirical studies related to this topic, each of which relies on the diversity of Malagasy lemurs (representing a total of 19 species) and the comparative approach applied across scales of analysis. In Study 1, we compare gut microbial membership across 14 species in the wild to test the relative importance of host phylogeny and feeding strategy in mediating microbiome structure. Whereas host phylogeny strongly predicted community composition, the same feeding strategies shared by distant relatives did not produce convergent microbial consortia, but rather shaped microbiomes in host lineage‐specific ways, particularly in folivores. In Study 2, we compare 14 species of wild and captive folivores, frugivores, and omnivores, to highlight the importance of captive populations for advancing gut microbiome research. We show that the perturbational effect of captivity is mediated by host feeding strategy and can be mitigated, in part, by modified animal management. In Study 3, we examine various scent‐gland microbiomes across three species in the wild or captivity and show them to vary by host species, sex, body site, and a proxy of social status. These rare data provide support for the bacterial fermentation hypothesis in olfactory signal production and implicate steroid hormones as mediators of microbial community structure. We conclude by discussing the role of scale in comparative microbial studies, the links between feeding strategy and host–microbiome coadaptation, the underappreciated benefits of captive populations for advancing conservation research, and the need to consider the entirety of an animal's microbiota. Ultimately, these studies will help move the field from exploratory to hypothesis‐driven research.\n",

      "Population genomic analysis of hybrid zones is instrumental to our understanding of the evolution of reproductive isolation. Many temperate hybrid zones are formed by the secondary contact between two parental populations that have undergone post-glacial range expansion. Here we show that explicitly accounting for historical parental isolation followed by range expansion prior to secondary contact is fundamental for explaining genetic and fitness patterns in these hybrid zones. Specifically, ancestral population expansion can result in allele surfing where neutral or slightly deleterious mutations drift to high frequency at the expansion front. If these surfed deleterious alleles are recessive, they can contribute to substantial heterosis in hybrids produced at secondary contact, counteracting negative effects of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (BDMIs) hence weakening reproductive isolation. When BDMIs are linked to such recessive deleterious alleles the fitness benefit of introgression at these loci can facilitate introgression at the BDMIs. The extent to which this occurs depends on the strength of selection against the linked deleterious alleles and the distribution of recombination across the chromosome. Finally, surfing of neutral loci can alter the expected pattern of population ancestry, thus accounting for historical population expansion is necessary to develop accurate null genomic models of secondary-contact hybrid zones.\n",

      "the nipple and areola (HNA) was clinically suspected. Histological examination of a biopsy specimen of a lesion on the right areola showed hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and acanthosis. Numerous mature sebaceous lobules and fascicles of smooth muscle were present in the dermis, which is normal for the areola (Fig. 2a). In the thickened epidermis, there were several keratinocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm (koilocytes). Neither atypical keratinocytes nor sebaceous cells were found (Fig. 2b). In situ hybridization using a GenPoint HPV Kit (Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA, USA) detected HPV-6/11 diffusely in the upper layer of epidermis and horny cell layer (Fig. 2c). High magnification showed HPV-6/11 DNA on the vacuolated keratinocytes (koilocytes) in the granular cell layer (Fig. 2d). However, HPV-16, which belongs to the high oncogenic risk group, was not detected (data not shown). We diagnosed this case as CA of the nipple and areola and treated the patient with carbon dioxide (CO2) laser (scan mode, 30 W, four times) with remarkable effect (Fig. 1b). There have been no recurrences for one year. Wood reported the first case of CA of the nipple in 1978. A 20-year-old Caucasian man with a history of Dariers disease presented with a papillary tumor that covered the left nipple. Microscopic examination showed marked vacuolization of superficial epidermal cells, and electron microscopy disclosed the intranuclear, round, dense particles in keratinocytes characteristic of HPV. Kulke et al. cloned a new HPV-6 subtype, HPV-6ma, from atypically located CA of the nipple from a 14-year-old male suffering from atopic dermatitis. Compared with the prototype HPV-6b, the isolate was found to contain an exact 236-bp duplication in the long control region, leading to increased enhancer activity. This indicates that the duplication within the HPV-6 isolate from the nipple may influence early gene expression and possibly tissue tropism. Kowalzick et al. described a 44-year-old Caucasian man with multiple papillomas on the nipple that clinically and histologically resembled CA. HPV-41 DNA sequences were detected in the biopsy material. Our patient had been given a clinical diagnosis of seborrheic keratosis or HNA; however, the existence of koilocytes and findings of the presence of HPV-6/11 DNA by ISH led us to diagnose CA. As far as we know, no other HPV subtypes resembling seborrheic keratosis in the nipple have been reported. It is possible that CA of the nipple has been misdiagnosed as seborrheic keratosis or HNA because of its unusual location and clinical features. It is important to find koilocytes histologically and to perform ISH in order to diagnose CA and advise patients to avoid infecting others.\n",

      "Research has identified that gram-negative bacteria have an important role in refractory nasal polyps. In the present study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to establish a mouse model with neutrophilic nasal polyps in order to explore the effect and mechanism of LPS on the formation of neutrophilic nasal polyps in mice. A total of 5 or 10 µg of LPS was dropped into the nasal cavities of C57BL/6J mice in order to establish animal models with neutrophilic nasal polyps. Histological staining, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cluster of differentiation 68 for macrophages and myeloperoxidase for neutrophil immunohistochemistry were used to observe histopathological changes in the nasal mucosa. The expression levels of cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17 in the nasal lavage fluid, were detected by ELISA. Compared with the control group, mice in the LPS groups exhibited significant mucosa epithelial cell damage and nasal polyp formation. Furthermore, TLR4+ cells, macrophages, neutrophils and significantly increased levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17 in the nasal lavage fluids were indicated (all P=0.008). These findings indicated that LPS is able to activate the TLR4 receptor pathway to induce the formation of neutrophilic nasal polyps in mice. Additionally, LPS administration was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of macrophages, T helper (Th) 1 and Th17-related cytokines (P=0.009, P=0.008 and P=0.008, respectively). Therefore, the present model is commensurate with the characteristics of primary nasal polyps that have been identified in the Asian population.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the time required for hypertension and proteinuria to resolve after preeclampsia, and to estimate how this time to resolution correlates with the levels of blood pressure and proteinuria during preeclampsia and prolonging pregnancy after the development of preeclampsia. METHODS: This is a historic prospective cohort study of 205 preeclamptic women who were admitted between 1990 and 1992 at the Erasmus MC Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Data were collected at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after delivery. Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or higher or use of antihypertensive drugs. Proteinuria was defined as 0.3 g/d or more. Resolution of hypertension and proteinuria were analyzed with the Turnbull extension to the Kaplan-Meier procedure. Correlations were calculated with an accelerated failure time model. RESULTS: At 3 months postpartum, 39% of women still had hypertension, which decreased to 18% at 2 years postpartum. Resolution time increased by 60% (P<.001) for every 10-mm Hg increase in maximal systolic blood pressure, 40% (P=.044) for every 10-mm Hg increase in maximal diastolic blood pressure, and 3.6% (P=.001) for every 1-day increase in the diagnosis-to-delivery interval. At 3 months postpartum, 14% still had proteinuria, which decreased to 2% at 2 years postpartum. Resolution time increased by 16% (P=.001) for every 1-g/d increase in maximal proteinuria. Gestational age at onset of preeclampsia was not correlated with resolution time of hypertension and proteinuria. CONCLUSION: The severity of preeclampsia and the time interval between diagnosis and delivery are associated with postpartum time to resolution of hypertension and proteinuria. After preeclampsia, it can take up to 2 years for hypertension and proteinuria to resolve. Therefore, the authors suggest that further invasive diagnostic tests for underlying renal disease may be postponed until 2 years postpartum. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III\n",

      "Purpose. The appearance of a stimulus depends on its background, with high-contrast backgrounds resulting in lower perceived contrast. Increased perceptual surround suppression effects have been reported in the elderly. Our experiments tested whether enhanced surround suppression in the elderly arises because of age-dependent differences in brightness induction mechanisms that are sensitive to phase information at the border of the central stimulus. Methods. Fifteen younger (18 to 33 years) and 18 older (61 to 84 years) adults participated. Using a method of constant stimuli, perceived contrast was measured for a sine wave grating with and without an annular surround. Annuli were either in-phase with the central grating (suppresses the perceived central contrast) or out-of-phase (typically enhances perceived central contrast). The experiment was repeated using stimuli where the contrast was reduced for younger observers to approximately match the effective contrast available to older adults. Results. With the surround present, the older group matched the contrast of the central target to an average lower contrast than younger adults [F(1,31) = 17.4, p < 0.001]. The magnitude of contrast suppression differences between older and younger observers was invariant of annulus grating phase [F(1,31) = 0.036, p = 0.85] and was of similar magnitude when the stimuli were approximately matched between groups for differences in contrast detection [F(1,31) = 0.06, p = 0.81]. Conclusions. Normal ageing increases perceived contrast surround suppression, irrespective of information at the stimulus border between center and surround. Conditions that result in perceived contrast enhancement on average in younger adults result in contrast suppression in the elderly. Our findings suggest that age-related differences are likely in the appearance of objects in natural environments where background contrast varies.\n",

      "Most studies of settlement cues in sessile marine invertebrates have focused on species with the potential to disperse over great distances. This persistent focus has perpetuated the idea that long-distance dispersing species may rely on cues to settle in specific habitats, whereas shortdistance dispersers are delivered directly into a favorable habitat. I tested the effects of water movement and substrate on the settlement of the temperate solitary cup coralBalanophyllia elegans, a species whose crawl-away larvae disperse just centimeters before settling. Ninety percent of larvae settled within 3 days of release in the presence of both natural rock substrate and moving water, but fewer than 11% settled in the same period when either or both factors were absent. An additional experiment revealed that when natural rock substrate was available, water velocities of less than 25 cm s 1 triggered a 5-fold increase in settlement rate relative to standing water. When settling, the larvae of B. elegans respond strongly to the interactive effects of water flow and substrate. Thus, settlement cues may play a significant role in generating the patchy distribution of B. elegans, a pattern previously attributed to short-distance dispersal. Larval settlement is a critical stage in the life history of sessile marine invertebrates. This transition from a mobile larval stage to a sessile juvenile stage represents a commitment to a particular location, and determines the subsequent\n",

      "Abstract Background Nonadherence to medication is a burden to the US health care system and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Data on outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) treatment plan adherence are lacking. The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of nonadherence and factors associated with it. Methods We surveyed patients discharged from a tertiary hospital on OPAT between February and August 2019 about their baseline characteristics, OPAT regimen, adherence, and experience with OPAT. Results Sixty-five patients responded to the survey. The median age was 62 years, and 56% were male. The rate of reported nonadherence to intravenous (IV) antibiotics was 10%. Factors associated with nonadherence to IV antibiotics included younger age, household income of <$20 000, and lack of time for administering IV antibiotics (30 vs 64 years, P < .01; 83% vs 20%, P < .01, and 33% vs 4%, P = .04, in the nonadherent vs adherent groups, respectively), while less frequent administration (once or twice daily) and having friend or family support during IV antibiotic administration were associated with better adherence (17% vs 76%, P < .01, and 17% vs 66%, P = .03, in the nonadherent vs adherent groups, respectively). Most patients attended their infectious diseases clinic visits (n = 44, 71%), and the most commonly cited reasons for missing an appointment were lacking transportation (n = 12, 60%), not feeling well (n = 8, 40%), and being unaware of the appointment (n = 6, 30%). Conclusions Less frequent antibiotic dosing and better social support were associated with improved adherence to OPAT.

      "ABSTRACT Introduction: Surufatinib (also known as HMPL-012, sulfatinib) is a novel oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which has the dual activity of anti-angiogenesis and immune regulation. In December 2020, surufatinib was approved as a monotherapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic, progressive nonfunctioning, well differentiated (grade 1 or 2) extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (epNETs) in China. Areas covered: In this paper, the chemical properties, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of surufatinib for treatment of advanced extrapancreatic NETs are introduced in detail. We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed and the following keywords were used: ‘surufatinib,’ ‘sulfatinib’ and ‘HMPL-012.’ Expert opinion: Surufatinib is a potent, selective, and small-molecule TKI that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Surufatinib showed an acceptable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity in patients with advanced epNETs. The most frequently observed adverse events (AEs) were hypertension and proteinuria. Surufatinib provides a new treatment option for patients with advanced epNETs. More clinical trials of surufatinib are ongoing to develop a combination of therapy strategies and new indications for malignancies.\n",

      "SUMMARY Continuous growth, associated with a steady parental food supply, is a general pattern in offspring development. So that young chicks can acquire their locomotor independence, this period is usually marked by a fast maturation of muscles, during which different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms are expressed. However, parental food provisioning may fluctuate seasonally, and offspring therefore face a challenge to ensure the necessary maturation of their tissues when energy is limited. To address this trade-off we investigated muscle maturation in both the pectoral and pelvic girdles of king penguin chicks. This species has an exceptionally long rearing period (1 year), which is prolonged when parental food provisioning is drastically reduced during the sub-Antarctic winter. Approximately 1 month post hatching, chicks acquire a functional pedestrian locomotion, which uses pelvic muscles, whereas swimming, which uses the pectoral muscles, only occurs 1 year later. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the MyHC content of the leg muscles reaches a mature state before those of the pectoral muscles. We found that leg muscle MyHC composition changed with the progressive acquisition of pedestrian locomotion, whereas pectoral muscle fibres reached their mature MyHC profile as early as hatching. Contrary to our predictions, the acquisition of the adult profile in pectoral muscles could be related to an early maturation of the contractile muscular proteins, presumably associated with early thermoregulatory capacities of chicks, necessary for survival in their cold environment. This differential maturation appears to reconcile both the locomotor and environmental constraints of king penguin chicks during growth.\n",

      "Transcriptional control of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) promoter, the long terminal repeat (LTR), is achieved by interactions with cis-acting elements present both upstream and downstream of the start site. In silico transcription factor binding analysis of the HIV-1 subtype B LTR sequences revealed a potential downstream CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) binding site. This binding site (+158 to+172), designated DS3, was found to be conserved in 67% of 3,858 unique subtype B LTR sequences analyzed in terms of nucleotide sequence as well as physical location in the LTR. DS3 was found to be well represented in other subtypes as well. Interestingly, DS3 overlaps with a previously identified region that bind members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of proteins. NFATc2 exhibited a higher relative affinity for DS3 as compared with members of the C/EBP family (C/EBP α and β). DS3 was able to compete efficiently with the low-affinity upstream C/EBP binding site I with respect to C/EBP binding, suggesting utilization of both NFAT and C/EBP. Moreover, cyclosporine A treatment, which has been shown to prevent dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT isoforms, resulted in enhanced C/EBPα binding. The interactions at DS3 were also validated in an integrated HIV-1 LTR in chronically infected U1 cells. A binding knockout of DS3 demonstrated reduced HIV-1 LTR-directed transcription under both basal and interleukin-6-stimulated conditions only in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage cells and not in cells of T-cell origin. Thus, the events at DS3 positively regulate the HIV-1 promoter in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage.\n",

      "Background To improve patients’ comprehension of bowel preparation instructions before colonoscopy, enhanced patient education (EPE) such as cartoon pictures or other visual aids, phone calls, mobile apps, multimedia education and social media apps have been proposed. However, it is uncertain whether EPE can increase the detection rate of colonic polyps and adenomas. Objective This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of EPE in detecting colonic polyps and adenomas. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from their inception to June 2019 for the identification of trials comparing the EPE with standard patient education for outpatients undergoing colonoscopy. We used a random effects model to calculate summary estimates of the polyp detection rate (defined as the number of patients with at least one polyp divided by the total number of patients undergoing selective colonoscopy), adenoma detection rate (defined as the number of patients with at least one adenoma divided by the total number of patients undergoing selective colonoscopy), advanced adenoma detection rate (defined as the number of patients with at least one advanced adenoma divided by the total number of patients undergoing selective colonoscopy), sessile serrated adenoma detection rate (defined as the number of patients with at least one sessile serrated adenoma divided by the total number of patients undergoing selective colonoscopy), cancer detection rate (defined as the number of patients with at least one cancer divided by the total number of patients undergoing selective colonoscopy), or adenoma detection rate - plus (defined as the number of additional adenomas found after the first adenoma per colonoscopy). Moreover, we conducted trial sequential analysis (TSA) to determine the robustness of summary estimates of all primary outcomes. Results We included 10 randomized controlled trials enrolling 4560 participants for analysis. The meta-analysis suggested that EPE was associated with an increased polyp detection rate (9 trials; 3781 participants; risk ratio [RR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.35; P<.05; I2=42%) and adenoma detection rate (5 trials; 2133 participants; RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15-1.64; P<.001; I2=0%), which were established by TSA. Pooled result from the inverse-variance model illustrated an increase in the sessile serrated adenoma detection rate (3 trials; 1248 participants; odds ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.22-2.53; P<.05; I2=0%). One trial suggested an increase in the adenoma detection rate - plus (RR 4.39, 95% CI 2.91-6.61; P<.001). Pooled estimates from 3 (1649 participants) and 2 trials (1375 participants) generated no evidence of statistical difference for the advanced adenoma detection rate and cancer detection rate, respectively. Conclusions The current evidence indicates that EPE should be recommended to instruct bowel preparation in patients undergoing colonoscopy because it can increase the polyp detection rate, adenoma detection rate, and sessile serrated adenoma detection rate. However, further trials are warranted to determine the efficacy of EPE for advanced adenoma detection rate, adenoma detection rate - plus, and cancer detection rate because of limited data.\n",

However, whether Maf1 is required for lifespan extension caused by mTOR inhibition, such as dietary restriction (DR) or calorie restriction (CR) remains elusive. Here we show that deletion of maf1 in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae but not mafr-1 in C. elegans prevents DR or CR to extend lifespan. Interestingly, mafr-1 deletion increases stress tolerance and extends lifespan. MAFR-1 is phosphorylated in a mTOR-dependent manner and mafr-1 deletion alleviates the inhibition of tRNA synthesis caused by reduced mTOR activity. We find that the opposite effect of mafr-1 deletion on lifespan is due to an enhancement of stress response, including oxidative stress response, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and autophagy. mafr-1 deletion also attenuates the paralysis of a C. elegans model of Alzheimer's disease. Our study reveals distinct mechanisms of lifespan regulation by Maf1 and MAFR-1.\n",

      "The distribution of catecholamine‐containing neurons, fibers, and varicosities in the brainstem of both adult and juvenile dogs was mapped in detail with glyoxylic acid histofluorescence. Four separate groups of catecholamine‐fluorescent neurons were identified within the canine medulla and pons in locations comparable to the A1, A2, A5, and A6 regions reported in other species. However, aspects of the pattern and density of the catecholaminergic neuronal systems appeared to be unique to the dog. The A1 neurons of the caudal ventrolateral medulla were much more scattered than in rats or rabbits, but relatively similar to cats. In the A2 region of the dorsomedial medulla, catecholaminergic cells and fibers were uniquely distributed compared to other species: fluorescent neurons were scattered only within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and a distinctive pattern of fibers and varicosities outlined the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The A5 neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla appeared at the rostral limit of the A1 region. Fluorescent A5 cells were more sparse than in rats or primates, and were patterned similarly to cats and rabbits. The canine A6 region contained the most extensive and dense grouping of catecholamine neurons and was similar in pattern to the rabbits but less extensive than that seen in cats or primates. An ascending catecholaminergic fiber pathway was traced through the central tegmental field of the canine medulla and pons, with features similar to the primate. The present study provides the first description of the catecholaminergic neuronal systems of the canine medulla.\n",

      "More than a decade ago, Solomon Benatar and Peter Singer argued that “a new, proactive research ethics…must ultimately be concerned with reducing inequities in global health and achieving justice in health research and health care.” Towards this objective, a limited amount of recent scholarship has started to consider whether a theoretical basis exists for the position that international research should help promote global health equity and, if so, what the implications are for its conduct. Theories of justice from political philosophy establish obligations for parties in high-income countries to improve the health of parties in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These theories have been shown to provide grounds for the claim that international research should be conducted to advance justice in global health. What this means for research actors from high-income countries is the focus of a recently proposed ethical framework: “research for health justice.”\n",

      "P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a transmembrane protein conferring multidrug resistance to cells by extruding a variety of amphipathic cytotoxic agents using energy from ATP hydrolysis. The objective of this study was to understand how substrates affect the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis by Pgp. The ATPase activity of purified and reconstituted recombinant human Pgp was measured using a continuous cycling assay. Pgp hydrolyzes ATP in the absence of drug at a basal rate of 0.5 μmol·min·mg−1 with aK m for ATP of 0.33 mm. This basal rate can be either increased or decreased depending on the Pgp substrate used, without an effect on the K m for ATP or 8-azidoATP and K i for ADP, suggesting that substrates do not affect nucleotide binding to Pgp. Although inhibitors of Pgp activity, cyclosporin A, its analog PSC833, and rapamycin decrease the rate of ATP hydrolysis with respect to the basal rate, they do not completely inhibit the activity. Therefore, these drugs can be classified as substrates. Vanadate (Vi)-induced trapping of [α-32P]8-azidoADP was used to probe the effect of substrates on the transition state of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. TheK m for [α-32P]8-azidoATP (20 μm) is decreased in the presence of Vi; however, it is not changed by drugs such as verapamil or cyclosporin A. Strikingly, the extent of Vi-induced [α-32P]8-azidoADP trapping correlates directly with the fold stimulation of ATPase activity at steady state. Furthermore, Pi exhibits very low affinity for Pgp (K i ∼30 mm for Vi-induced 8-azidoADP trapping). In aggregate, these data demonstrate that the release of Vi trapped [α-32P]8-azidoADP from Pgp is the rate-limiting step in the steady-state reaction. We suggest that substrates modulate the rate of ATPase activity of Pgp by controlling the rate of dissociation of ADP following ATP hydrolysis and that ADP release is the rate-limiting step in the normal catalytic cycle of Pgp.\n",

      "METHODS\n",
      "The sample included 130 youth (9-14 years): youth with an anxiety disorder (ANX; n = 100) and healthy control (HC; n = 30) youth with no lifetime DSM-IV disorders. ANX youth were randomized to either a manualized cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) or a comparison child-centered therapy (CCT). The ERN was assessed before and after 16 sessions of treatment and within a comparable interval for HC. Subjective ratings about making errors on the task were obtained following each testing session. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT00774150.\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "The ERN was larger in ANX than HC youth but ERN magnitude did not significantly change following treatment in the ANX youth, regardless of treatment type, and baseline ERN did not predict treatment response. Post-task ratings revealed that ANX youth worried more about task performance feedback than HC. Like the ERN, mean ratings did not significantly change following treatment. However, these ratings were not correlated with ERN amplitude.\n",

      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "Findings of greater ERN in pediatric anxiety disorders are replicated in a larger sample. More importantly, findings from this randomized control trial show that a larger ERN and feeling worried about performance feedback remain unchanged following treatment and are unrelated to treatment response. Such findings suggest that action monitoring systems remain overactive in anxious youth treated with psychotherapy, suggesting the need for future investigation of whether novel complimentary cognitive and emotional training programs can modify these systems would be warranted.\n",

      "Introduction The number of gynaecological cancer survivors is increasing and there is a need for a more sustainable model of follow-up care. Today’s follow-up model is time-consuming and patients have reported unmet needs regarding information about their cancer and strategies for managing the consequences of treatment. The main aim of this study is to assess health-related empowerment—in terms of patient education, psychosocial support, and promotion of physical activity—in a new follow-up model by comparing it to standard follow-up in a quasi-randomised study involving intervention hospitals and control hospitals. Methods and analysis At the intervention hospitals, patients will be stratified by risk of recurrence and late effects to either 1 or 3 years’ follow-up. Nurses will replace doctors in half of the follow-up visits and focus in particular on patient education, self-management and physical activity. They will provide patients with information and guide them in goal setting and action planning. These measures will be reinforced by a smartphone application for monitoring symptoms and promoting physical activity. At the control hospitals, patients will be included in the standard follow-up programme. All patients will be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and after 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Blood samples will be collected for biobanking at 3, 12 and 36 months. The primary outcome is health-related empowerment. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, adherence to physical activity recommendations, time to recurrence, healthcare costs and changes in biomarkers. Changes in these outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear mixed models for repeated measures. Type of hospital (intervention or control), time (measurement point), and possible confounders will be included as fixed factors. Ethics and dissemination The study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (2019/11093). Dissemination of findings will occur at the local, national and international levels. Trial registration number NCT04122235.\n",

      "The heart plays the vital role of propelling blood to the entire body, which is essential to life. While maintaining heart function is critical, adult mammalian hearts poorly regenerate damaged cardiac tissue upon injury and form scar tissue instead. Unlike adult mammals, adult zebrafish can regenerate injured hearts with no sign of scarring, making zebrafish an ideal model system with which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying heart regeneration. Investigation of heart regeneration in zebrafish together with mice has revealed multiple cardiac regeneration genes that are induced by injury to facilitate heart regeneration. Altered expression of these regeneration genes in adult mammals is one of the main causes of heart regeneration failure. Previous studies have focused on the roles of these regeneration genes, yet the regulatory mechanisms by which the expression of cardiac regeneration genes is precisely controlled are largely unknown. In this review, we will discuss the importance of differential gene expression for heart regeneration, the recent discovery of cardiac injury or regeneration enhancers, and their impact on heart regeneration.\n",

      "Abstract Natural genetic variants of Neuregulin1 (NRG1) and its cognate receptor ErbB4 are associated with a risk for schizophrenia. Whereas most studies on NRG1-ErbB4 signaling have focused on GABAergic interneurons, ErbB4 is also expressed by midbrain dopaminergic neurons where it modulates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels. Here, we report that extracellular steady-state levels of DA are reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; −65%), hippocampus (−53%) and nucleus accumbens (NAc; −35%), but are elevated in the dorsal striatum (+25%) of ErbB4 knock-out mice (ErbB4 KOs) relative to wild-type controls. This pattern of DA imbalance recapitulates the reported prefrontal cortical reduction and striatal increase of DA levels in schizophrenia patients. Next, we report on a battery of behavioral tasks used to evaluate locomotor, cognitive and motivational behaviors in ErbB4 KOs relative to controls. We found that ErbB4 KOs are hyperactive in a novel open field but not in their familiar home cage, are more sensitive to amphetamine, perform poorly in the T-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks, exhibit reduced spatial learning and memory on the Barnes maze, and perform markedly worse in conditioned place preference (CPP) tasks when associating cued-reward palatable food with location. However, we found that the poor performance of ErbB4 KOs in CPP are likely due to deficits in spatial memory, instead of reward seeking, as ErbB4 KOs are more motivated to work for palatable food rewards. Our findings indicate that ErbB4 signaling affects tonic DA levels and modulates a wide array of behavioral deficits relevant to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells requires the inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase complexes. An apparent exception to this relationship is found in Schizosaccharomyces pombemutants with mutations of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). These conditional lethal mutants arrest with unsegregated chromosomes because they cannot degrade the securin, Cut2p. Although failing at nuclear division, these mutants septate and divide. Since septation requires Cdc2p inactivation in wild-type S. pombe, it has been suggested that Cdc2p inactivation occurs in these mutants by a mechanism independent of cyclin degradation. In contrast to this prediction, we show that Cdc2p kinase activity fluctuates in APCcut mutants due to Cdc13/cyclin B destruction. In APC-null mutants, however, septation and cutting do not occur and Cdc13p is stable. We conclude that APC cut mutants are hypomorphic with respect to Cdc13p degradation. Indeed, overproduction of nondestructible Cdc13p prevents septation in APC cutmutants and the normal reorganization of septation initiation network components during anaphase.\n",

      "Background: Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) is a precancerous lesion of cholangiocarcinoma, for which surgical resection is the most effective treatment. We evaluated the predictors of malignancy in IPNB according to anatomical location and the prognosis without surgery. Methods: A total of 196 IPNB patients who underwent pathologic confirmation by surgical resection or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic biopsy were included. Clinicopathological findings of IPNB with invasive carcinoma or mucosal dysplasia were analyzed according to anatomical location. Results: Of the 116 patients with intrahepatic IPNB (I-IPNB) and 80 patients with extrahepatic IPNB (E-IPNB), 62 (53.4%) and 61 (76.3%) were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that mural nodule > 12 mm (p = 0.043) in I-IPNB and enhancement of mural nodule (p = 0.044) in E-IPNB were predictive factors for malignancy. For pathologic discrepancy before and after surgery, IPNB has a 71.2% sensitivity and 82.3% specificity. In the non-surgical IPNB group, composed of nine I-IPNB and seven E-IPNB patients, 43.7% progressed to IPNB with invasive carcinoma within 876 days. Conclusions: E-IPNB has a higher rate of malignancy than I-IPNB. The predictive factor for malignancy is mural nodule > 12 mm in I-IPNB and mural nodule enhancement in E-IPNB.\n",

Each mouse was immunized with 100 μg of the corresponding plasmid DNA by intramuscular injection. 28 days post-vaccination, the mice were challenged with S. japonicum cercariae, and the worm and egg burdens were determined 42 days post-challenge. Serum samples were collected from all the mice before and after vaccination and at the end of the experiment, and used for antibody detection. The IFN-γ and IL-4 levels were quantified in the supernatants of specifically stimulated spleen cells. The number of worms was reduced by 52%, 40% and 42% in mice respectively immunized with pVIVO2SjFABP-23, pVIVO2Sj23 or pVIVO2SjFABP. A respective 61%, 38% and 39% egg reduction was determined relative to those mice that only received the empty pVIVO2 plasmid. pVIVO2SjFABP-23 immunization increased IgG levels against SWAP and SEA. Increased IFN-γ levels were detected in the supernatant of specific stimulated spleen cells from mice immunized with the 3 different constructs.

      "Abstract Background The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendon rupture and factors leading to this rupture during the follow-up of patients who underwent volar plate fixation because of distal radius fracture. Patients and Methods A total of 109 distal radius fractures of 102 patients treated with volar plate fixation and periodically followed up for at least 1 year between January 2013 and May 2018 were evaluated. Fractures were categorized according to the AO Foundation/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) Fracture-Dislocation Classification and Soong's grading was used for classifying volar plate position. All patients operated were inquired retrospectively in terms of flexor tendon rupture. Results Gender distribution revealed 45 females and 57 males. Mean age was 47.9 (range: 17–88) years. Mean period of follow-up was 27 months. Distribution of fractures in accordance with the AO/OTA distal radius classification was 6, 8, 7, 12, 24, 33, 11, and 8 patients with types A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, and C3, respectively. When volar plate positions were analyzed with Soong's classification, it revealed that 79 (72.4%), 23 (21.1%), and 7 (6.5%) plates were grade 0, 1, and 2, respectively. In total, evaluating the three patients with FPL rupture, it revealed that the volar plate was positioned distally during fixation because the fracture line had advanced to the distal of the watershed line, the distal portion of the plate had lost complete connection with the bone, and at this portion, it was observed that the pronator quadratus muscle was not covering the plate entirely (Soong's classification grade 2). Patients did not have additional flexor tendon injury. Conclusion FPL tendon rupture is a rare but serious complication of volar plate fixation performed for distal radius fractures. We believe that appropriate choice of implant and careful surgical technique, along with the close follow-up of patients, with Soong's classification grade-2 volar positions would help in preventing this complication. Level of Evidence This is a Level 3a, differential diagnosis/symptom prevalence study.\n",

      "ABSTRACT In acute lung injuries, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibits surfactants by hydrolyzing phospholipids. Because hyaluronan (HA) reduces hydrolysis of phospholipids by sPLA2, and because sPLA2 inhibits surfactant in vitro, the authors hypothesized HA would reduce sPLA2 inhibition. Surfactants were used alone or mixed with HA and/or sPLA2 then tested for surface activity in 2 separate assays, or for sPLA2 activity. Equilibrium surface pressures were identical for surfactant with or without HA. sPLA2 inhibited surface activity but this inhibitory effect was reduced with HA by 14% in the spreading trough and by 63% in a modified bubble surfactometer. Hyaluronan caused a modest reduction (39%) of sPLA2 breakdown of labeled phospholipid. Therefore hyaluronan reduces inhibition of surfactants by sPLA2 in vitro, and reduces the activity of the enzyme.\n",

      "Background: Clustering of vascular risk factors, i.e., the co-existence of two or more risk factors, has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. This study aims to firstly, examine patterns of clustering of major cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk patients and their relation with the risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Secondly, to assess which combinations are associated with the highest risk of CVD and all-cause mortality and to study population attributable fractions. Methods: A total of 12,616 patients from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort – Second Manifestations of ARTerial diseases (UCC-SMART) study consisting of patients with or a high risk to develop cardiovascular disease were studied. We constructed sixteen clusters based on four individual modifiable risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, overweight). Patients were followed from September 1997 to March 2017. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute adjusted hazard ratios for CVD risk and all-cause mortality and 95% confidence intervals for clusters, with patients without any risk factor as reference group. The population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age and sex. Results: During a mean follow-up period of 8.0 years, 1836 CVD events were registered. The prevalence of patients with zero, one, two, three, and four risk factors was 1.4, 11.4, 32.0, 44.8 and 10.4%. The corresponding hazard ratios (HR) for CVD risk and all-cause mortality were 1.65 (95% CI 0.77; 3.54) for one risk factor, 2.61 (1.24; 5.50) for two, 3.25 (1.55; 6.84) for three, and 3.74 (1.77; 7.93) for four risk factors, with patients without any risk factor as reference group. The PAFs were 6.9, 34.0, 50.1 and 22.2%, respectively. The smoking-hypertension-dyslipidemia combination was associated with the highest HR: 4.06 (1.91; 8.63) and the hypertension-dyslipidemia combination with the highest PAF: 37.1%. Conclusion: Clusters including smoking and hypertension contributed to the highest risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. This study confirms that risk factor clustering is common among patients at high-risk for CVD and is associated with an increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.\n",

      "Background The results of previous studies on the association between blood mercury (Hg) and bone mineral density (BMD) are inconsistent. We therefore used a large-scale nationwide representative sample of Korean men to investigate the relationship between these two parameters. Methods A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the 2008 to 2010 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to evaluate the relationship between blood Hg and BMD and the prevalence of osteopenia or osteoporosis in 1,190 men over 50 years of age. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteopenia and osteoporosis were diagnosed for each body site according to World Health Organization T-score criteria. Results After adjusting for age, body mass index, caloric energy and calcium intake, vitamin D levels, fish consumption, alcohol consumption, smoking, and exercise, quartiles of blood Hg were positively associated with femur neck T-scores in multiple linear regression analysis (β=0.06, P-value=0.03). Compared with the lowest blood Hg quartile, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis in the second and fourth quartiles were 0.63 (0.41–0.99) and 0.57 (0.36–0.91), respectively, in the femur neck after adjusting for the same co-variables. Conclusion High blood Hg levels were associated with reduced odds of decreased femur neck BMD in Korean men. However, subgroup analysis did not show a significant protective effect of blood Hg on osteoporotic fractures. Further research is necessary to clarify the association between blood Hg and BMD.\n",

      "Rationale: Long-term clinical implications of beta-blockade in obstructive airway diseases remains controversial. We investigated if within the first 5 years of treatment patients with heart failure and obstructive airway diseases using non β1-adrenoreceptor selective beta-blockers have an increased risk of being hospitalized for all-causes, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when compared to patient using selective beta-blockers. Methods: Carvedilol users were propensity matched 1:1 for co-treatments, age, gender, and year of inclusion in the cohort with metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to compare all causes, COPD, and heart failure hospitalization or the beta-blocker discontinuation between cohorts. For statistically significant associations, we computed the rate difference and the attributable risk. Results: Overall, 11,844 patients out of the 51,214 (23.1%) were exposed to carvedilol and 39,370 (76.9%) to metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol. Carvedilol users had a higher hazard for heart failure hospitalization (HR 1.29; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.18–1.40) with 106 (95%CI 76–134; p-value < 0.001) additional cases of heart failure hospitalization per 10000 person-years if compared to metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. In all, 26.8% (95%CI 22.5–30.9%; p-value < 0.001) of heart failure hospitalizations in the study population could be attributed to being exposed to carvedilol. Carvedilol users had a higher hazard (HR 1.06; 95%CI 1.02–1.10) of discontinuing the pharmacological treatment with 131 (95%CI 62–201; p-value < 0.001) additional cases of beta-blocker discontinuation per 10000 person-years metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. In all, 6.5% (95%CI 3.9–9.0%; p-value < 0.001) of beta-blocker discontinuation could be attributed to being exposed to carvedilol. Conclusion: On long-term follow-up period, carvedilol was associated with a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization and discontinuation if compared to metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users among patients with heart failure and obstructive airway diseases.\n",

      "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of carbon‐ion radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy using dacarbazine, nimustine, and vincristine (DAV therapy) in mucosal melanoma. Twenty‐one patients with clinically localized mucosal melanoma of the head and neck were enrolled. The primary endpoint was 3‐year overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included local control, progression‐free survival (PFS), and adverse event occurrence. Carbon‐ion radiotherapy with a dose of 57.6‐64.0 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions was delivered concurrently with DAV therapy, and 2 cycles of adjuvant DAV therapy were administered every 6 weeks. The median follow‐up periods were 15.5 months for all patients, and 31.2 months for 12 surviving patients. All patients had locally advanced T4a or T4b disease in the rhino‐sinus area. In 16 patients (76.2%), 3 cycles of planned DAV therapy were completed. The 3‐year OS and PFS rates were 49.2% and 37.0% respectively. The 3‐year local control rate was 92.3%. Eleven patients (52%) developed distant metastasis, which was the most frequent pattern of the first failure. Commonly presenting acute grade 2‐3 toxicities associated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy were mucositis (11 patients [53%]) and leukopenia (9 patients [43%]), which improved with conservative therapy. None of the patients developed grade 3 or greater late toxicities. Carbon‐ion radiotherapy in combination with DAV therapy led to excellent local control for advanced mucosal melanoma within acceptable toxicities. The efficacy of additional DAV therapy in improving survival was weaker than expected as distant metastases still occurred frequently. Trial registration no. UMIN000007939.\n",

      "PEG‐ADA is a long‐circulating form of adenosine deaminase (ADA) that has been in use for <8 years as replacement therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency disease due to ADA deficiency. Treatment with PEG‐ADA almost completely corrects metabolic abnormalities, allowing the recovery of a variable degree of immune function. Although not normal, the level of function achieved has in most cases been sufficient to protect against opportunistic and life‐threatening infections. PEG‐ADA has been used as an alternative for patients who lack an HLA‐identical bone marrow donor, but are judged to be at too high a risk for undergoing HLA‐haploidentical marrow transplantation. To date, mortality and morbidity with PEG‐ADA have been less than for the latter procedure. PEG‐ADA has also been an important adjunct to attempts to develop somatic cell gene therapy for ADA deficiency, although its continued use poses a problem for evaluation of the benefit of gene therapy. As a true “orphan drug” developed to treat a very small patient population, the cost per patient of PEG‐ADA is very high. © Wiley‐Liss, Inc.\n",

      "The plasma soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) is a marker of lung epithelial injury with prognostic value when measured at baseline in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, whether changes in plasma sRAGE could inform prognosis in ARDS remains unknown. In this secondary analysis of the Lung Imaging for Ventilator Setting in ARDS (LIVE) multicenter randomized controlled trial, which evaluated a personalized ventilation strategy tailored to lung morphology, plasma sRAGE was measured upon study entry (baseline) and on days one, two, three, four and six. The association between changes in plasma sRAGE over time and 90-day survival was evaluated. Higher baseline plasma sRAGE (HR per-one log increment, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.16–2.03; p = 0.003) and an increase in sRAGE over time (HR for each one-log increment in plasma sRAGE per time unit, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02; p < 10−3) were both associated with increased 90-day mortality. Each 100-unit increase in the plasma sRAGE level per unit of time increased the risk of death at day 90 by 1% in joint modeling. Plasma sRAGE increased over time when a strategy of maximal alveolar recruitment was applied in patients with focal ARDS. Current findings suggest that the rate of change in plasma sRAGE over time is associated with 90-day survival and could be helpful as a surrogate outcome in ARDS.\n",

      "Discs large 1 (Dlg1) is a modular scaffolding protein implicated in the control of cell polarity through assembly of specific multiprotein complexes, including receptors, ion channels and signaling proteins, at specialized zones of the plasma membrane. Recent data have shown that in addition to these well‐known interaction partners, Dlg1 may also recruit components of the vesicle trafficking machinery either to the plasma membrane or to transport vesicles. Here, we discuss Dlg1 function in vesicle formation, targeting, tethering and fusion, in both the exocytotic and endocytotic pathways. These pathways contribute to cell functions as major and diverse as glutamatergic activity in the neurons, membrane homeostasis in Schwann cell myelination, insulin stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes, or endothelial secretion of the hemostatic protein, von Willebrand factor (VWF).\n",

      "The aim of the study was to investigate the association between elevated serum fetuin-A and increased urine albumin excretion in obese rats, and whether increased urine albumin excretion was modified by improving hepatic steatosis and lipid metabolism disorder. Male Wistar rats 4 weeks in age were randomly divided into three groups and fed with normal chow (control group), high-fat chow (obesity group), or high-fat chow plus fenofibrate (fenofibrate group). After 24 weeks, both body weight and visceral fat/body weight ratio in obese rats were higher than in controls. A difference in serology markers and pathology associated with hepatic steatosis was also found among the three groups. Serum fetuin-A and the expression of NF-κB in the liver were increased, while serum adiponectin was decreased in obese rats in comparison to controls (P < 0.01). Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was increased in the obesity group compared to controls (P < 0.01). The fenofibrate intervention reduced serum fetuin-A and NF-κB expression in the liver and increased serum adiponectin compared to obese rats and was accompanied by decrease in ACR. A positive correlation was found between ACR and fetuin-A (r = 0.602, P < 0.01), and a negative correlation was found between ACR and adiponectin (r = −0.635, P < 0.01). We conclude that elevated fetuin-A levels are associated with microalbuminuria in obese rats, and abnormal albuminuria is reversible by improving hepatic steatosis.\n",

      "For the non-invasive assessment of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), surrogates like pulse wave transit time (PWTT) have been proposed. The aim of this study was to invasively validate for which kind of PAP (systolic, mean, or diastolic) PWTT is the best surrogate parameter. To assess both PWTT and PAP in six healthy pigs, two pulmonary artery Mikro-Tip™ catheters were inserted into the pulmonary vasculature at a fixed distance: one in the pulmonary artery trunk, and a second one in a distal segment of the pulmonary artery. PAP was raised using the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 (TXA) and by hypoxic vasoconstriction. There was a negative linear correlation between PWTT and systolic PAP (r = 0.742), mean PAP (r = 0.712) and diastolic PAP (r = 0.609) under TXA. During hypoxic vasoconstriction, the correlation coefficients for systolic, mean, and diastolic PAP were consistently higher than for TXA-induced pulmonary hypertension (r = 0.809, 0.778 and 0.734, respectively). Estimation of sPAP, mPAP, and dPAP using PWTT is feasible, nevertheless slightly better correlation coefficients were detected for sPAP compared to dPAP.

      "The serum bone turnover markers (BTM) procollagen type 1 N‐terminal propeptide (P1NP) and C‐terminal cross‐linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) are recommended for monitoring adherence and response of antiresorptive drugs (ARD). BTM are elevated about 1 year after fracture and therefore BTM target values are most convenient in ARD treatment follow‐up of fracture patients. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the cut‐off values of P1NP and CTX showing the best discriminating ability with respect to adherence and treatment effects, reflected in bone mineral density (BMD) changes. Furthermore, we explored the ability of BTM to predict subsequent fractures and BTM variation during daytime in patients using ARD or not. After a fragility fracture, 228 consenting patients (82.2% women) were evaluated for ARD indication and followed for a mean of 4.6 years (SD 0.5 years). BMD was measured at baseline and after 2 years. Serum BTM were measured after 1 or 2 years. The largest area under the curve (AUC) for discrimination of patients taking ARD or not was shown for P1NP <30 μg/L and CTX <0.25 μg/L. AUC for discrimination of patients with >2% gain in BMD (lumbar spine and total hip) was largest at cut‐off values for P1NP <30 μg/L and CTX <0.25 μg/L. Higher P1NP was associated with increased fracture risk in patients using ARD (hazard ratio [HR]logP1NP = 15.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7–83.3), p = 0.002. P1NP and CTX were stable during daytime, except in those patients not taking ARD, where CTX decreased by 21% per hour during daytime. In conclusion, P1NP <30 μg/L and CTX <0.25 μg/L yield the best discrimination between patients taking and not taking ARD and the best prediction of BMD gains after 2 years. Furthermore, higher P1NP is associated with increased fracture risk in patients on ARD. BTM can be measured at any time during the day in patients on ARD. © 2022 The Authors.

      "Background and Purpose— The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to study the effectiveness of self-managed computer treatment for people with long-standing aphasia after stroke. Method— In this pilot single-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial participants with aphasia were allocated to self-managed computer treatment with volunteer support or usual care (everyday language activity). The 5-month intervention period was followed by 3 months without intervention to investigate treatment maintenance. Results— Thirty-four participants were recruited. Seventeen participants were allocated to each group. Thirteen participants from the usual care group and 15 from the computer treatment group were followed up at 5 months. An average of 4 hours 43 minutes speech and language therapy time and 4 hours volunteer support time enabled an average of 25 hours of independent practice. The difference in percentage change in naming ability from baseline at 5 months between groups was 19.8% (95% CI, 4.4–35.2; P=0.014) in favor of the treatment group. Participants with more severe aphasia showed little benefit. Results demonstrate early indications of cost-effectiveness of self-managed computer therapy. Conclusion— This pilot trial indicates that self-managed computer therapy for aphasia is feasible and that it will be practical to recruit sufficient participants to conduct an appropriately powered clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of self-managed computer therapy for people with long-standing aphasia.

      "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tumour genotyping is crucial to guide treatment decisions regarding the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, some patients may not be able to obtain tumour testing, either because tissue is limited and/or tests are not routinely offered. Here, we aimed to build a model-based nomogram to allow for prediction of the presence of EGFR mutations in NSCLC. We retrospectively collected clinical and pathological data on 3,006 patients with NSCLC who had their tumours genotyped for EGFR mutations at five institutions worldwide. Variables of interest were integrated in a multivariate logistic regression model. In the 2,392 non-Asian patients with lung adenocarcinomas, the most important predictors of harbouring EGFR mutation were: lower tobacco smoking exposure (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.37–0.46), longer time interval between smoking cessation and diagnosis (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.71–2.80), advanced stage (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18–2.13), and papillary (OR 4.57, 95% CI 3.14–6.66) or bronchioloalveolar (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.98–4.06) histologically predominant subtype. A nomogram was established and showed excellent discriminating accuracy: the concordance index on an independent validation dataset was 0.84. As clinical practices transition to incorporating genotyping as part of routine care, this nomogram could be highly useful to predict the presence of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma in non-Asian patients when mutational profiling is not available or possible.\n",

The resulting ‘fibroblast like’ cells were shown to be endothelial by expression of von Willebrand factor (VWF), ICAM‐1 (CD54), E‐selectin (CD62E) and PECAM (CD31). Endothelial monolayers seeded with CD34+ UCB cells supported expansion of colony forming cells and CD34+ cells. We conclude that endothelial cell precursors circulate in UCB, and may be derived from the CD34+ cell fraction.\n",

      "Although Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) has been linked to the loss of function of imprinted genes in 15q11q13, very little is known about the pathogenesis. Using quantitative real‐time PCR, we have confirmed the previous observation of an abnormality of CD36 expression in cells with maternal uniparental disomy 15, obtained from a proband with mosaicism for PWS, by demonstrating reduced expression levels in blood cells from a series of non‐mosaic probands with PWS. Furthermore, we have extended these observations to show that CD36 expression in a non‐PWS population is inversely correlated with body mass index but that this correlation does not hold in PWS. CD36 which maps to 7q11.2 is the first gene outside the 15q11q13 region whose level of expression appears to be reduced in people with PWS. Low CD36 expression levels in PWS point to an abnormal control of lipid and glucose homeostasis which may explain the insatiable hunger in these patients.\n",

The 673 men in the intervention group and their families, were offered advice to reduce their risk during two home visits and later by quarterly newsletters. Follow-up blood samples drawn 1.5 years following the home-visit, show a small reduction in total cholesterol and an increase in the ratio of HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol.

      "Background: Research has demonstrated that breast milk significantly decreases morbidities that impact length of stay for preterm infants, but there is a need to test interventions to improve breastfeeding outcomes. Since many Americans are using technologies such as the Intranet and smartphones to find health information and manage health, a Web site was developed for mothers who provide breast milk for their preterm hospitalized infants. Purpose: This study examined the efficacy of a Web site for mothers to educate them about breast milk expression and assist them in monitoring their breast milk supply. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from mothers whose preterm infants were hospitalized in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or transitional care unit (TCU) in an urban academic medical center in the Midwest. Results: Eighteen mothers participated in evaluation of the Web site. Thirteen mothers consistently logged on to the password-protected Web site (mean [standard deviation] = 13.3 [11.7]) times. Most participants, (69.2%), reported they used the breast milk educational information. Most mothers indicated that using the Web site log helped in tracking their pumping. These findings can be used to direct the design and development of web-based resources for mothers of preterm infants Implications for Practice: NICU and TCU staffs need to examine and establish approaches to actively involve mothers in monitoring the establishment and maintenance of an adequate supply of breast milk to improve neonatal health outcomes. Implications for Research: An electronic health application that incorporates the features identified in this study should be developed and tested.\n",

      "The rapid rise of monkeypox (MPX) cases outside previously endemic areas prompts for a better understanding of the disease. We studied the plasma proteome of a group of MPX patients with a similar infection history and clinical manifestation typical for the current outbreak. We report that MPX in this case series is associated with a strong plasma proteomic response among nutritional and acute phase response proteins. Moreover, we report a correlation between plasma proteins and disease severity. Contrasting the MPX host response with that of COVID‐19, we find a range of similarities, but also important differences. For instance, CFHR1 is induced in COVID‐19, but suppressed in MPX, reflecting the different roles of the complement system in the two infectious diseases. Of note, the spatial overlap in response proteins suggested that a COVID‐19 biomarker panel assay could be repurposed for MPX. Applying a targeted protein panel assay provided encouraging results and distinguished MPX cases from healthy controls. Hence, our results provide a first proteomic characterization of the MPX human host response and encourage further research on protein‐panel assays in emerging infectious diseases.\n",

      "Background: Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is a common clinical occurrence. Recently, much evidence has been gathered to suggest that oxygen free radicals are implicated in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-reoxygenation injury through the initiation and propagation of toxic cascades including glutamate excitotoxicity and the manifestation of post-HI neurologic disorders. Following HI, excessive free radicals are formed and antioxidant defenses are diminished. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically available antioxidant and has been previously shown to reduce oxidative stress and scavenge free radicals in multiple models of brain injury. Objectives: Using an acutely instrumented swine model of neonatal hypoxia-reoxygenation, the objective of the present study was to examine the neurochemical effects of NAC administration in 5 brain regions exquisitely vulnerable to severe hypoxia. Methods: In a blinded fashion, newborn piglets (1–4 d, 1.4–2.2 kg) were block randomized into surgical sham (SHAM), hypoxic control (HC) and NAC-treated (H-NAC) groups. Both HC and H-NAC piglets were subject to 2 h of alveolar hypoxia (paO2 = 20–40 mm Hg) and then resuscitated with 100% O2 for 1 h followed by 21% for an additional 3 h. Results: Our results show that two hours of severe hypoxemia causes metabolic acidosis and significant changes in cerebral amino acids including glutamate, aspartate and alanine, in all brain regions investigated including the cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. The administration of NAC 10 min into the reoxygenation period and subsequently continued as an infusion, maintains post-resuscitation amino acid neurochemistry at the levels observed in SHAM piglets. Conclusions: In newborn piglets that have sustained brain injury related to hypoxia/reoxygenation, the administration of NAC does not disrupt cerebral amino acid balance and maintains cerebral amino acid homeostasis.\n",

      "The VL30 sequences of mouse DNA are a family of sequences with retrovirus-like structure which code for a 30S RNA transcript that can be packaged into the virions of murine leukemia viruses and thereby transmitted from cell to cell. A Southern blot analysis of these sequences revealed that multiple copies are present in the DNA of all mice examined, regardless of species or geographic origin. Considerable locus polymorphism was also apparent, and at least one of these polymorphisms appeared to reflect the differing chromosomal location of a complete VL30 sequence. These data indicated that VL30 elements are not recent additions to the mouse genome and suggested that the evolution of the VL30 multigene family has been accompanied by duplication and dispersion of VL30 sequences to diverse genomic sites. In addition, we reexamined the issue of genetic relatedness between mouse VL30 sequences and a physically similar family of virus-like elements in the rat genome. We found that many, if not all, rat and mouse VL30 loci contain regions of sequence homology. These data suggested that rodent VL30 sequences have evolved from a common ancestral sequence.\n",

      "Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cbl protooncogene has been shown to occur after engagement of a number of different receptors on hematopoietic cells. However, the mechanisms by which these receptors induce Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that engagement of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon R1) leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and analyze how this occurs. We show that at least part of Fc epsilon R1-induced Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated by the Syk tyrosine kinase, and that the Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl occurs mainly distal to the Cbl proline-rich region within the COOH-terminal 250 amino acids. Furthermore, we show by coprecipitation that Cbl is present in a complex with Syk before receptor engagement, that the proline-rich region of Cbl and a region of Syk comprised of the two SH2 domains and intradomain linker are required for formation of the complex, and that little or no tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl is detected in complex with Syk. Overexpression of truncation mutants of Cbl capable of binding Syk has the effect of blocking tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Cbl. These results define a potentially important intramolecular interaction in mast cells and suggest a complex function for Cbl in intracellular signaling pathways.\n",

      "The transport of neuropeptides from central ganglia to components of the feeding system was studied in Aplysia. Peptide transport was determined by incubating buccal or cerebral ganglia with 35S-methionine and measuring the appearance of labeled peptides by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of extracts of target tissues. Selected nerves were left intact and passed through a Vaseline diffusion barrier separating the ganglia and their targets. Five major labeled peptides were observed to be transported from the buccal ganglia to feeding muscles. They were buccalin, FMRFamide, myomodulin, and 2 small cardioactive peptides. Each of these peptides has been shown to modulate the responses of these muscles to their motor neurons. The peptides were transported by fast axonal transport, as judged by the distance transported and the sensitivity to colchicine. When normalized to correct for differences in total incorporation, the patterns of peptide transport were reproducible between animals. The nature and amount of the peptides transported were different for different muscles. The nature of peptide transport also varied for different nerve groups. These results support the proposition that these 5 peptides act as modulatory transmitters at feeding muscles. No transport of neuropeptides from the cerebral ganglia to feeding muscles was observed, although myomodulin was specifically transported to the buccal ganglia. This suggests that this peptide may play an important role in the previously observed regulation of buccal ganglia activity by neurons in the cerebral ganglia.\n",

      "Summary: Of 103 mothers who delivered an extremely low birth‐weight (ELBW, < l,000g) infant, 29% were primiparous; 51% of those who were multiparous had at least one previous miscarriage or perinatal death. The 41 (40%) mothers who decided against subsequent pregnancy were significantly older than the remaining mothers. Mothers were also significantly more likely to decide against subsequent pregnancy if their ELBW infant had survived. The outcome of subsequent pregnancies within 3 years of the ELBW birth was ascertained; 28% ended in miscarriage, 3% in stillbirth, 1% in neonatal death, 21% in a surviving preterm infant and 51% in a survivor born at term. Mothers diagnosed to have cervical incompetence had a significantly higher risk of a subsequent preterm birth. During the study period, 87% of mothers who became pregnant subsequent to their ELBW infant gave birth to at least one surviving child. Of the subsequent livebirths, 36% were less than 2,500g, 11% were less than l,500g and 5% were less than l,000g. Significantly more mothers whose ELBW infant had died conceived again within 1 year compared to those whose ELBW infant had survived. The necessary time for recovery from bereavement may be cut short by the subsequent pregnancy. The psychological problems as a result of unresolved mourning which mothers experience and their effects on subsequent children need to be further studied.\n",

      "Abstract Background: Onset of puberty is dependent on pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). The kisspeptin-GPR54 signaling system has a considerable role in GnRH physiology and induction of puberty. Objectives: To evaluate kisspeptin levels in girls with central precocious puberty (CPP) at the time of the diagnosis and during follow-up, to determine whether or not kisspeptin may serve as a marker for diagnosis and follow-up of CPP. Patients and methods: Kisspeptin levels of 28 girls with CPP were measured at the time of diagnosis and repeated at the 6th month of therapy after complete pubertal suppression and compared to kisspeptin levels of 13 age-matched prepubertal controls. Results: Kisspeptin levels of girls with CPP (10.2±2.6 pg/mL) were higher than those in controls (8.6±1.5 pg/mL (p<0.019). There was a significant decline in the kisspeptin levels (7.3±1.3 pg/mL) of girls with CPP after pubertal suppression (p<0.0001). Conclusion: These findings suggest that kisspeptin levels can be used as corroborative evidence for diagnosis of CPP and a valuable parameter for monitoring treatment efficacy.\n",

      "BACKGROUND Previous studies indicated that both Plantago major and Aloe vera have anti-inflammatory, tissue regeneration, antioxidant, and immune-stimulatory effects. It is assumed that a mixture of these two herbal medicines may provide a potent material in treatment of skin wound injuries. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effects of Plantago major and Aloe vera mixture in the process of wound healing in rat models according to stereological parameters. METHODS In an experiential study, 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats (200±20 g) were randomly assigned into three groups (n=12): The control group which received no treatment, gel base treated group, and the 5% Plantago major and 5% Aloe vera mixture gel treated group (PA group). Treatments were done every 24 hrs for 15 days. Wound closure rate, volume densities of the collagen bundles and the vessels, vessel’s length density and mean diameter, and fibroblast populations were estimated using stereological methods. RESULTS PA treated group showed faster wound closure rate in comparison with control and gel-base groups (p<0.05). Numerical density of fibroblasts, volume density of collagen bundles, mean diameter, and volume densities of the vessels in PA group were significantly higher than the control and the gel-base treated groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION We showed that Plantago major and Aloe vera mixture has the ability to improve wound healing by enhancing fibroblast proliferation, collagen bundle synthesis and re-vascularization in skin injuries.\n",

      "Prostacyclin and its analogues (prostanoids) are potent vasodilators, and exhibit antithrombotic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterised by vasoconstriction, thrombosis and proliferation, and is associated with reduced synthesis of endogenous prostacyclin. This provides a strong rationale for the use of prostanoids to treat PAH, a concept that is now supported by more than two decades of clinical research and experience. Intravenous and subcutaneous prostanoids have clearly demonstrated efficacy in severe PAH, but adverse events related to the drug delivery system, systemic side-effects and tachyphylaxis have driven research into alternative prostanoid treatments. Iloprost is administered by inhalation, and thus avoids most of the systemic side-effects associated with i.v. or subcutaneous prostanoid infusion. Two randomised controlled 12-week trials in patients with PAH have demonstrated efficacy and a favourable safety profile for iloprost as monotherapy (the AIR trial) and in combination with oral bosentan (STEP). Open-label uncontrolled long-term studies of inhaled iloprost therapy indicate that this treatment may improve long-term outcomes in PAH.\n",

      "Axonally specific microtubule-associated protein tau is an important component of neurofibrillary tangles found in AD (Alzheimer's disease) and other tauopathy diseases such as CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy). Such tau aggregate is found to be hyperphosphorylated and often proteolytically fragmented. Similarly, tau is degraded following TBI (traumatic brain injury). In the present study, we examined the dual vulnerability of tau to calpain and caspase-3 under neurotoxic and neurodegenerative conditions. We first identified three novel calpain cleavage sites in rat tau (four-repeat isoform) as Ser130↓Lys131, Gly157↓Ala158 and Arg380↓Glu381. Fragment-specific antibodies to target the major calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K (35 kDa tau-breakdown product) and the caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K respectively were developed. In rat cerebrocortical cultures treated with excitotoxin [NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate)], tau is significantly degraded into multiple fragments, including a dominant signal of calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K with minimal caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K. Following apoptosis-inducing EDTA treatment, tau was truncated only to TauBDP-48K/45K-exclusively by caspase. Cultures treated with another apoptosis inducer STS (staurosporine), dual fragmentation by calpain (TauBDP-35K) and caspase-3 (TauBDP-45K) was observed. Tau was also fragmented in injured rat cortex following TBI in vivo to BDPs of 45–42 kDa (minor), 35 kDa and 15 kDa, followed by TauBDP-25K. Calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K-specific antibody confirmed robust signals in the injured cortex, while caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K-specific antibody only detected faint signals. Furthermore, intravenous administration of a calpain-specific inhibitor SNJ-1945 strongly suppressed the TauBDP-35K formation. Taken together, these results suggest that tau protein is dually vulnerable to calpain and caspase-3 proteolysis under different neurotoxic and injury conditions.\n",

      "This review summarizes the nature of acute fluoride toxicity, its time-course, and the fluoride doses that are involved. The generally accepted \"certainly lethal dose\" range for 70 kg adults, i.e., from 5 to 10 g of sodium fluoride or from 32 to 64 mg fluoride/kg, is discussed. Based on recent case reports of fluoride-induced fatalities, it is concluded that this dose range has little utility in cases involving young children. The concept of a \"probably toxic dose\" (PTD) is advanced. The PTD, 5.0 mg Flkg, is defined as the dose of ingested fluoride that should trigger immediate therapeutic intervention and hospitalization because of the likelihood of serious toxic consequences. The concentrations and quantities of fluoride in selected dental products are discussed in relation to the PTD. It is concluded that, as these products are currently packaged, most of them contain quantities of fluoride sufficient to exceed the PTD for young children. Recommendations are made to reduce the risk of toxicity associated with their use.\n",

      "We estimated selection on three morphological characters in the hermaphroditic, hawkmoth‐pollinated orchid Platanthera bifolia and explored selection surfaces through male and female function. The work was carried out in northern Sweden during two flowering seasons (1994 and 1995) in one natural population and one season (1995) in another natural population. Fitness was estimated as number of pollinia removed (male function) and number of fruits produced (female function). We detected directional selection towards larger inflorescence size (flower number) through both sex functions in both populations in 1995. In 1994, with an unusually dry growing season, 78% of the individuals failed to set any fruit, and there was selection for larger inflorescences only through male function. In this year, there was selection towards longer flower spurs, which could be a direct or indirect effect of spurs being shortened by drought. The results demonstrate that selection patterns may vary temporally and spatially, and that the ‘male function hypothesis’ may be applicable as female function is more resource dependent than male function.\n",

      "Microorganisms need to sense and respond to constantly changing microenvironments, and adapt their transcriptome, proteome, and metabolism accordingly to survive [1]. However, microbes sometimes react in a way which does not make immediate biological sense in light of the current environment—for example, by up-regulating an iron acquisition system in times of metal abundance. The reason for this seemingly nonsensical behavior can lie in the microbe's ability to predict a coming change in conditions by cues from the current environment. If the microbe (pre-)adapts accordingly, it will increase its fitness and chances of survival under subsequent selection pressures—a concept known as adaptive prediction (Figure 1) [2]. \n",

      "Background: Although unquestionable evidence has been provided that high-sensitive (HS) cardiac troponin (cTn) immunoassay outperform the former contemporary-sensitive techniques, some clinicians are still hesitant to implement HS methods in routine clinical practice. This study was hence planned to evaluate the impact of replacing a contemporary-sensitive with HS cTnI immunoassay on hospital and laboratory workload. Methods: Information on the total number of cTnI tests ordered, total number of blood samples collected, total number of CK-MB tests ordered, number of patients with the first HS-cTnI value below the limit of detection (LoD) and cumulative HS-cTnI values was extracted from the local hospital information system for the semesters before and after the HS method was introduced. Results: Although the total emergency department (ED) visits modestly increased after introducing HS-cTnI, the number of total cTnI tests declined by over 10%. A substantial reduction of single-sample test requests was noted, accompanied by a considerable decline of 3- and 4-sample collections (i.e., -61% and -73%, respectively). A high percentage of patients (27.5%) displayed HS-cTnI values <LoD at admission, thus allowing safe discharge. The introduction of HS cTnI immunoassay was effective to collapse the number of CK-MB test requested and also generated favorable return of investment for the part of laboratory budget concerning cTnI testing (-3.2% of total costs for cTnI and -99.8% of total costs for CK-MB). Conclusion: The results of this study show substantial organizational and economic benefits by replacing contemporary-sensitive with HS cTnI immunoassays. (www.actabiomedica.it)\n",

      "Expression of the steffimycin gene cluster in Steptomyces albus in combination with plasmids directing the biosynthesis of different neutral and branched‐chain deoxyhexoses led to the identification of twelve new glycosylated derivatives of steffimycin with different degrees of decoration in the tetracyclic core. These experiments demonstrate the flexibility of L‐rhamnosyltransferase StfG for recognition of a variety of D‐ and L‐deoxyhexoses, harboring different degrees of deoxygenation as 2‐deoxyhexoses, 2,6‐deoxyhexoses, and 2,3,6‐deoxyhexoses, and their attachment to 8‐demethoxy‐10‐deoxysteffimycinone. In addition, the flexibility of 3′‐O‐methyltransferase OleY, from Streptomyces, for the methylation of deoxyhexoses attached to the steffimycin aglycone is shown by expression of oleY in Streptomyces steffisburgensis, leading to the isolation of 3′‐O‐methylsteffimycin. Analysis of the biological activities of these compounds against three human tumor cell lines—breast adenocarcinoma, non‐small cell lung cancer, and colon adenocarcinoma—revealed two of them, 3′‐O‐methylsteffimycin and D‐digitoxosyl‐8‐demethoxy‐10‐deoxysteffimycinone, to possess improved antitumor activities, showing GI50 values below 1.0 μM, while steffimycin’s GI50 values fluctuate between 2.61 to 6.79 μM depending upon the cell line used. The antitumor activity data provide some insights into the structure–activity relationships of the new steffimycin derivatives, in relation to the configuration of hydroxy groups at positions C‐3′ and C‐4′ of the sugar moiety and positions C‐8 and C‐10 of the tetracyclic core.\n",

      "Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) gene mutation causes GGCX syndrome (OMIM: 137167), which is characterized by pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)-like symptoms and coagulation impairment. Here, we present a 55-year-old male with a novel homozygous deletion mutation, c.2,221delT, p.S741LfsX100, in the GGCX gene. Histopathological examination revealed calcium deposits in elastic fibers and vessel walls, and collagen accumulation in the mid-dermis. Studies of dermal fibroblasts from the patient (GGCX dermal fibroblasts) demonstrated that the mutated GGCX protein was larger, but its expression level and intracellular distribution were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type GGCX protein. Immunostaining and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed an increase in undercarboxylated matrix gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (ucMGP), a representative substrate of GGCX and a potent calcification inhibitor, indicating that mutated GGCX was enzymatically inactive. Under osteogenic conditions, calcium deposition was exclusively observed in GGCX dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, GGCX dermal fibroblast cultures contained 23- and 7.7-fold more alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive cells than normal dermal fibroblast cultures (n = 3), without and with osteogenic induction, respectively. Expression and activity of ALP were higher in GGCX dermal fibroblasts than in normal dermal fibroblasts upon osteogenic induction. mRNA levels of other osteogenic markers were also higher in GGCX dermal fibroblasts than in normal dermal fibroblasts, which including bone morphogenetic protein 6, runt-related transcription factor 2, and periostin (POSTN) without osteogenic induction; and osterix, collagen type I alpha 2, and POSTN with osteogenic induction. Together, these data indicate that GGCX dermal fibroblasts trans-differentiate into the osteogenic lineage. This study proposes another mechanism underlying aberrant calcification in patients with GGCX syndrome.\n",

      "Abstract Purpose: This study aims to describe the current provision of trauma rehabilitation in Antananarivo, Madagascar and explore the experiences and perspectives of users of this service in order to inform future research and service development. Material and methods: A qualitative study supplemented by a descriptive service review were applied in the central government hospital in Antananarivo. Registers in the rehabilitation department were analyzed for a 3 month period. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of users of the rehabilitation service and were subject to thematic analysis. Results: One in six patients treated in the rehabilitation department has survived a traumatic injury, with limb injuries comprising the majority. Analysis of interviews with 10 adult patients, following traumatic injuries to the lower limbs (6), upper limbs (3) or polytrauma (1) generated seven broad themes: health seeking behavior, organization of services, clinical management, costs and financial impact, effect on function and role, psychological impact and societal attitudes. Conclusions: Financial constraints and impact on personal finances pervade the overall picture. The perspectives and experiences elucidated will inform future research into the development of context-specific models of care for people with trauma-related disabilities in Madagascar. Implications for rehabilitation Potentially treatable traumatic injury can have a profound effect on function and societal participation in Madagascar. Interventions to increase access to timely acute trauma care and rehabilitation are needed, and may include different models of financing and innovations to reduce materials costs and length of stay. A structured rehabilitation pathway must be integrated to the earliest stages of trauma care, including scrutinizing the use of prolonged immobilization. Consideration should be given to models of care which are financially and geographically accessible to the population.\n",

      "Purpose of review Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant, hereditary polyposis syndrome defined by gastrointestinal hamartomas and mucocutaneous pigmentations, caused by a germline mutation in the serine/ threonine kinase 11 or liver kinase B1 (STK11/LKB1) genes. Hamartomatous polyps located throughout the gastrointestinal tract can be complicated by bleeding and small bowel intussusception, potentially leading to the need for emergency surgery. Individuals suffering from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome have an increased lifetime risk of various forms of cancer (gastrointestinal, pancreatic, lung, breast, uterine, ovarian and testicular). Surveillance should lead to the prevention of complications and thus a reduction in mortality and morbidity of patients. Recent findings A combined approach based on wireless capsule endoscopy, magnetic resonance enterography and device-assisted enteroscopy is effective in reduction of the polyp burden and thus decreasing the risk of bleeding and intussusception. Current guidelines for screening and surveillance are mostly based on expert opinion rather than evidence. Summary Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is an emerging disease that significantly affects the quality of life enjoyed by patients. Despite of all the progress in improved early diagnostics, options for advanced endoscopic therapy and elaborate surveillance, acute and chronic complications decrease the life expectancy of patients suffering from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n",

      "Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an ubiquitous serine-threonine protein kinase that participates in a multitude of cellular processes and has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of TDZD-8, a potent and selective GSK-3β inhibitor, on the development of lung injury caused by administration of bleomycin (BLM). Mice subjected to intra-tracheal administration of BLM developed significant lung injury characterized by marked neutrophil infiltration and tissue edema. An increase in immunoreactivity to nitrotyrosine, iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1β was also observed in the lungs of BLM-treated mice. In contrast, administration of BLM-treated mice with TDZD-8 (1 mg/kg daily) significantly reduced (I) the degree of lung injury, (II) the increase in staining (immunohistochemistry) for myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitrotyrosine, iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1β and (III) the degree of apoptosis, as evaluated by Bax and Bcl-2 immunoreactivity and TUNEL staining. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate treatment with the GSK-3β inhibitor TDZD-8 reduces the development of lung injury and inflammation induced by BLM in mice.\n",

      "Phantom limbs refer to the sensation that an amputated or missing limb is still attached to the body. Phantom limbs may be perceived as continuous with the stump so as to resemble a normal limb, or as “telescoped” with the more distal portion of the phantom being perceived as having withdrawn within the stump. Telescoping tends to be related to increased levels of phantom pain, making it a clinically relevant phenomenon to investigate. In the current study we show that a full-body illusion can be used to induce the sensation of a telescoped limb in healthy individuals. For the induction of the full-body illusion, participants saw the body of a mannequin from a first person perspective while being subjected to synchronized visuo-tactile stimulation through stroking. Crucially, the mannequin was missing its left hand so as to resemble an amputee. By manipulating the positioning of the strokes applied to the mannequin's stump with respect to the participants’ hand we were able to evoke the sensation of the participants’ hand being located either below the stump or, more crucially, “inside” the stump, i.e., telescoped. In three separate experiments these effects were supported by complementary subjective data from questionnaires, verbally reported perceived location of the hand, and manual pointing movements indicating hand position (proprioceptive drift). Taken together our results show that healthy individuals can experience the body of an upper limb amputee as their own, and that this can be associated with telescoping sensations. This is a theoretically important observation as it shows that ownership of an entire body can be evoked in the context of gross anatomical incongruence for a single limb, and that telescoping sensations occur as a consequence of the body representation system trying to reduce this incongruence. Furthermore, the present study might provide a new platform for future studies of the relationship between telescoping and phantom pain in amputees.\n",

      "Rapamycin inhibits the mTOR (target of rapamycin) pathway and extends lifespan in multiple species. The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein is a negative regulator of mTOR. In humans, loss of the TSC protein results in a disorder characterized clinically by the growth of benign tumors in multiple organs, due to overactivation of mTOR inhibition. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are benign brain tumors associated with TSC that have traditionally been treated by surgery, but for which mTOR inhibitors have recently been suggested as potential alternative treatments. The duration of mTOR treatment for SEGAs might have to be prolonged, probably lifelong, because SEGAs usually grow back after treatment is stopped. This cohort of patients who will experience prolonged exposure to mTOR inhibitors should be carefully followed longitudinally to better document long term side effects, but also to compare their longevity with the one of similar patients with TSC. These patients represent a unique opportunity to study the potential anti-aging properties of mTOR inhibitors in humans.\n",

      "The ability of Plasmodium parasites to egress from their host red blood cell is critical for the amplification of these parasites in the blood. Previous forward chemical genetic approaches have implicated the subtilisin-like protease (SUB1) and the cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3) as key players in egress, with the final step of SUB1 maturation thought to be due to the activity of DPAP3. In this study, we have utilized a reverse genetics approach to engineer transgenic Plasmodium falciparum parasites in which dpap3 expression can be conditionally regulated using the glmS ribozyme based RNA-degrading system. We show that DPAP3, which is expressed in schizont stages and merozoites and localizes to organelles distinct from the micronemes, rhoptries and dense granules, is not required for the trafficking of apical proteins or processing of SUB1 substrates, nor for parasite maturation and egress from red blood cells. Thus, our findings argue against a role for DPAP3 in parasite egress and indicate that the phenotypes observed with DPAP3 inhibitors are due to off-target effects.\n",

Design and Methods The sample involved 1,222 males and females from the 1978/79 Ribeirão Preto birth cohort, Brazil, aged 23–25 years. NWO was defined as body mass index (BMI) within the normal range (18.5–24.9 kg/m2) and the sum of subscapular and triceps skinfolds above the sex-specific 90th percentiles of the study sample. It was also defined as normal BMI and % BF (body fat) >23% in men and >30% in women. Insulin resistance (IR), insulin sensitivity and secretion were based on the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) model. Results In logistic models, after adjusting for age, sex and skin colour, NWO was significantly associated with Metabolic Syndrome (MS) according to the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) definition (Odds Ratio OR = 6.83; 95% Confidence Interval CI 2.84–16.47). NWO was also associated with HOMA2-IR (OR = 3.81; 95%CI 1.57–9.28), low insulin sensitivity (OR = 3.89; 95%CI 2.39–6.33), and high insulin secretion (OR = 2.17; 95%CI 1.24–3.80). Significant associations between NWO and some components of the MS were also detected: high waist circumference (OR = 8.46; 95%CI 5.09–14.04), low High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 1.65; 95%CI 1.11–2.47) and high triglyceride levels (OR = 1.93; 95%CI 1.02–3.64). Most estimates changed little after further adjustment for early and adult life variables. Conclusions NWO was associated with MS and IR, suggesting that clinical assessment of excess body fat in normal-BMI individuals should begin early in life even in middle-income countries.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Background: The Cambridge Cognitive Examination-Revised (CAMCOG-R) is a sensitive screening tool for the early diagnosis of dementia in older adults. Overall performance on the CAMCOG-R is influenced by educational attainment. Few studies have, however, examined the association between educational attainment and performance on the individual CAMCOG subscales. We aimed to address this question in a sample from a low-and middle-income country (LAMIC), where resource constraints may have compromised access to, and quality of, education for many older adults. Methods: Participants, all over 60 years of age, were 51 cognitively healthy community-dwelling volunteers and 47 individuals diagnosed with mild-moderate stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most participants had some high school education. They were administered the CAMCOG-R under standardized conditions. Results: Within both the control and AD patient groups, there were significant associations between years of completed education and CAMCOG-R total score, MMSE score, and CAMCOG-R Language subscale score. In both groups, level of education was not associated with scores on these subscales: in controls, recent memory, R 2 = .21, p = .055, learning memory, R 2 = .16, p = .398, attention/calculation, R 2 = .19, p = .467, and perception, R 2 = .18, p = .984; in AD patients, recent memory, R 2 = .14, p = .340, learning memory, R 2 = .03, p = .680, perception, R 2 = .09, p = .723, and attention/calculation, R 2 = .19, p = .097. Conclusions: Some CAMCOG-R subscale scores were more strongly associated with educational attainment than others. Importantly, however, performance on the recent memory and learning memory subscales was not affected by education. These subscales are sensitive indicators of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. These subscales may therefore remain valid for use as an AD screening tool in resource-poor healthcare settings.\n",

      "Gender differences in the incidence of cardiovascular disease have been related to plasma estrogen levels; however, the role of vascular estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes in these sex differences is less clear. We tested whether the gender differences in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) function reflect differential expression/activity of ERα, ERβ and the newly-identified GPR30. Single aortic VSM cells (VSMCs) were freshly isolated from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, and their contraction to phenylephrine (PHE, 10-5 M), AngII (10-7 M) and membrane-depolarization by KCl (51 mM) was measured in the absence or presence of 10-6 M 17β-estradiol (E2, stimulant of most ERs), PPT (ERα agonist), DPN (ERβ agonist), and ICI 182,780 (an ERα/ERβ antagonist with GPR30 agonistic properties). The cells were fixed and fluorescently labeled with ERα, ERβ or GPR30 antibody, and the subcellular distribution of ERs was examined using digital imaging microscopy. The mRNA expression and protein amount of aortic ER subtypes was examined using RT-PCR and Western blots. PHE, AngII, and KCl caused less contraction in VSMCs of females than males. Pretreatment of VSMCs with E2 reduced PHE-, AngII- and KCl-induced contraction in both males and females. PPT caused similar inhibition of PHE-, AngII- and KCl-induced contraction as E2, suggesting a role of ERα. DPN mainly inhibited PHE and KCl contraction, suggesting an interaction between ERβ and Ca2+ channels. ICI 182,780 did not reduce aortic VSMC contraction, suggesting little role for GPR30. RT-PCR and Western blots revealed greater expression of ERα and ERβ in VSMCs of females than males, but similar amounts of GPR30. The total immunofluorescence signal for ERα and ERβ was greater in VSMCs of females than males, and was largely localized in the nucleus. GPR30 fluorescence was similar in VSMCs of males and females, and was mainly in the cytosol. In PPT treated cells, nuclear ERα signal was enhanced. DPN did not affect the distribution of ERβ, and ICI 182,780 did not significantly increase GPR30 in the cell surface. Thus, ER subtypes demonstrate similar responsiveness to specific agonists in VSMCs of male and female rats. The reduced contraction in VSMCs of females could be due to gender-related increase in the expression of ERα and ERβ.\n",

      "AbstractControversy remains regarding whether preoperative chemoradiation protocol should be applied uniformly to all rectal cancer patients regardless of tumor height. This pooled analysis was designed to evaluate whether preoperative chemoradiation can be safely omitted in higher rectal cancer.An international consortium of 7 institutions was established. A review of the database that was collected from January 2004 to May 2008 identified a series of 2102 patients with stage II/III rectal or sigmoid cancer (control arm) without concurrent chemoradiation. Data regarding patient demographics, recurrence pattern, and oncological outcomes were analyzed. The primary end point was the 5-year local recurrence rate.The local relapse rate of the sigmoid colon cancer (SC) and upper rectal cancer (UR) cohorts was significantly lower than that of the mid/low rectal cancer group (M-LR), with 5-year estimates of 2.5% for the SC group, 3.5% for the UR group, and 11.1% for the M-LR group, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that tumor depth, nodal metastasis, venous invasion, and lower tumor level were strongly associated with local recurrence. The cumulative incidence rate of local failure was 90.6%, 92.5%, and 94.4% for tumors located within 5, 7, and 9 cm from the anal verge, respectively.Routine use of preoperative chemoradiation for stage II/III rectal tumors located more than 8 to 9 cm above the anal verge would be excessive. The integration of a more individualized approach focused on systemic control is warranted to improve survival in patients with upper rectal cancer.\n",

      "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare malignancy comprising 1–2% of all thyroid cancers in the United States. Approximately 20% of cases are familial, secondary to a germline RET mutation, while the remaining 80% are sporadic and also harbour a somatic RET mutation in more than half of all cases. Up to 15–20% of patients will present with distant metastatic disease, and retrospective series report a 10-year survival of 10–40% from time of first metastasis. Historically, systemic therapies for metastatic MTC have been limited, and cytotoxic chemotherapy has demonstrated poor objective response rates. However, in the last decade, targeted therapies, particularly multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival in advanced and progressive MTC. Both cabozantinib and vandetanib have been approved as first-line treatment options in many countries; nevertheless, their use is limited by high toxicity rates and dose reductions are often necessary. New generation TKIs, such as selpercatinib or pralsetinib, that exhibit selective activity against RET, have recently been approved as a second-line treatment option, and they exhibit a more favourable side-effect profile. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors may also constitute potential therapeutic options in specific clinical settings. In this review, we aim to present all current therapeutic options available for patients with progressive MTC, as well as new or as yet experimental treatments.\n",

      "Serine protease 17 (PRSS17) has two aliases. In developing teeth it is designated enamel matrix serine proteinase 1 (EMSP1). In the prostate gland it is termed prostase. PRSS17 cDNAs have been cloned from pig (Simmer et al., 1998), mouse (Hu et al., 1999), and human (Simmer et al., 1999) tooth-specific cDNA libraries. The function of serine protease 17 is to degrade enamel proteins during the early maturation stage of amelogenesis, which is necessary to harden the enamel layer. Mutations in the serine protease 17 gene (PRSS17) are believed to cause amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), an inherited disease characterized by defective enamel formation. PRSS17 was mapped to facillitate linkage analyses in kindreds with AI.

      "Vesicle fusion is mediated by an assembly of SNARE proteins between opposing membranes, but it is unknown whether transmembrane domains (TMDs) of SNARE proteins serve mechanistic functions that go beyond passive anchoring of the force-generating SNAREpin to the fusing membranes. Here, we show that conformational flexibility of synaptobrevin-2 TMD is essential for efficient Ca2+-triggered exocytosis and actively promotes membrane fusion as well as fusion pore expansion. Specifically, the introduction of helix-stabilizing leucine residues within the TMD region spanning the vesicle’s outer leaflet strongly impairs exocytosis and decelerates fusion pore dilation. In contrast, increasing the number of helix-destabilizing, ß-branched valine or isoleucine residues within the TMD restores normal secretion but accelerates fusion pore expansion beyond the rate found for the wildtype protein. These observations provide evidence that the synaptobrevin-2 TMD catalyzes the fusion process by its structural flexibility, actively setting the pace of fusion pore expansion.

In order to establish the advantages and limitations of using Aib to design a peptide helix, that would otherwise be comprised of naturally occurring amino acids like Ala, it is important that a comparative analysis of release of the other resource required for this defense is triggered by the host upon contact with the pathogen. This newmechanism stands as a unique signal/response reaction and strikingly demonstrates how independent principles have developed for signal reception and response in marine algae.\n",

However, pertussis remains difficult to diagnose. We report a case of nosocomially acquired pertussis in a healthcare worker, diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction. The high sensitivity and rapid turnaround time for this test is useful to confirm the diagnosis when advising a healthcare worker to refrain from working.\n",

      "The venous muscle pump function was quantitatively assessed through pregnancy weeks 16, 30, 38 and 3 months (week 53) following delivery, in 24 pregnant women who completed a normal pregnancy. A statistically significant increase was found in the mean venous reflux (P<0 01), which was restored to initial values postpartum. Expelled calf volume remained stable throughout pregnancy but increased following delivery. Venous outflow from the legs was significantly reduced in the third trimester. Subjective symptoms of venous insufficiency increased trough pregnancy, but, these symptoms had virtually disappeared post partum, corresponding to the muscle pump normalization. No statistical correlation was found between venous muscle pump values and changes in hormone concentrations of estradiol, estriol and progesterone. It is suggested that venous insufficiency development in pregnancy is caused primarily by mechanical obstruction, or hormonal influence other than that of etradiol, estriol or progesterone.\n",

      "Objectives: Menopausal transition in women initiates with declining estrogen levels and is followed by significant changes in their physiological characteristics. These changes often lead to medical conditions, such as obesity, which is correlated with chronic low-grade/subclinical inflammation. Ocimum gratissimum L. is a food spice or traditional herb in many countries; the plant is rich in antioxidants, which possess anti-inflammation activities and multitude of other therapeutic functions. Methods: In this study, we evaluated effects of O. gratissimum extract (OGE) in preventing obesity by using ovariectomized (OVX) animal models to mimic menopausal women. Methods: OVX rats showed increase in body weight and in adipocyte size in perigonadal adipose tissue (p <0.05) and decrease in uterus weight. By contrast, OGE (0.2 mg/ml) significantly reduced body weight gain and adipocyte in OVX rats and showed insignificant changes in uterus weight. Further investigation indicated that OGE exerted no influence on levels of dorsal fat, serum total cholesterol, and serum triacylglycerol and on serum biochemical factors, calcium, phosphorus, and glucose. Conclusion: These findings suggested that OGE dietary supplements may be useful in controlling body weight of menopausal women.\n",

      "Abstract Aim: The aim of the current study was to collect clinical normative data for the Clinical Impairment Assessment questionnaire (CIA) and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) from adult patients with eating disorders (EDs). This study also examined unique contributions of eating disorder (ED) symptoms on levels of ED-related impairment. Methods: A sample of 667 patients, 620 females and 47 males, was recruited from six specialist centres across Norway. The majority of the sample (40.3%) was diagnosed with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), 34.5% had bulimia nervosa (BN), and 25.2% were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN). Results: There were significant differences for global EDE-Q and CIA scores between females and males. In the female sample, significant differences were found on several EDE-Q sub-scales between the AN and BN group, and between the AN and EDNOS group. No significant differences were found between the diagnostic groups on the CIA. In the male sample, no significant differences were found between diagnostic groups on the EDE-Q or CIA. A multiple regression analysis revealed that 46.8% of the variance in impairment as measured by the CIA was accounted for by ED symptoms. Conclusions: Body mass index, Eating Concern, Shape/Weight Concern, and binge eating served as significant, unique predictors of impairment. The results from the present study contribute to the interpretation of EDE-Q and CIA scores in ED samples.\n",

      "Here, we tested the hypothesis that a promiscuous bacterial cyclase generates a diverse cyclic nucleotide response in pulmonary endothelium. Pulmonary endothelial cells were infected with a gram‐negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A strain that introduces only ExoY (PA103 ΔexoUexoT::Tc pUCPexoY; ExoY+) via a type 3 secretion system was used for cellular infections. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PAECs and PMVECs) were infected with the ExoY+ strain at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1. PAECs and PMVECs both possess basal levels of 4 different cyclic nucleotides in the following rank order: cAMP > cUMP > cGMP ∼ cCMP. Endothelial gap formation was induced in a time‐dependent manner following ExoY+ intoxication. In PAECs, intercellular gaps formed within 2 h and progressively increased in size up to 6 h. Increasing levels of cGMP were seen by 1 h post‐infection, with cAMP and cUMP increasing at 3 h followed by cCMP by 4 h. In PMVECs, intercellular gaps did not form until 4 h with increased levels of only cGMP and cUMP at 3 and 6 h post‐infection, respectively. PAECs generated higher cyclic nucleotide levels than PMVECs, and the cyclic nucleotide levels increased much earlier in response to ExoY+ intoxication. Heterogeneity of the cyclic nucleotide signature in response to P. aeruginosa infection exists between PAECs and PMVECs, suggesting the intracellular milieu in PAECs is more conducive to cNMP generation.\n",

      "Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study was to work out the special features of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown origin in respect of diagnostic evaluation, clinical course, and outcome in a large cohort of patients. Methods: We reviewed the data of 179 patients with SAH of unknown origin during 1991 and 2008. The differentiation between perimesencephalic (PM-SAH) and non-perimesencephalic SAH (NON-PM-SAH) was done under consideration of the bleeding pattern on CT scanning. Results: Among 1226 treated patients with spontaneous SAH over a time period of 17 years, a bleeding source remained undetected on first digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) in 179 patients (16·7%) — 47 PM-SAH (26·3%) and 132 NON-PM-SAH (73·7%). The clinical signs of patients with PM-SAH were less marked compared to those with NON-PM-SAH, equally to the Hunt and Hess grade. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography had 100% negative findings for non-aneurismal bleeding sources in all patients. Second DSA revealed a bleeding source in the NON-PM group in 10·8%. The clinical course of the patients with NON-PM-SAH showed a significantly higher rate of complications and a mortality of about 10%. The outcome was excellent in the PM group, in contrast to a fatal course in 13 cases in the NON-PM group. Discussion: PM-SAH imposed with a mild clinical course and an excellent outcome, without severe complications. In contrast to this, NON-PM-SAH has a significant higher rate of dreaded complications and mortality. It is crucial to make an exact diagnosis of PM-SAH, considering CT scanning during the first 24 hours after occurrence of symptoms and the radiological features.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Background: Substance abuse is one of the most common health outcomes associated with adverse childhood experience, and poses a significant public health threat. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a relationship between adverse childhood experience and a substance use disorder using nationally representative data as well as to test whether religion moderates this relationship. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 11,279). Three types of adverse childhood experiences were considered; physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Logistic regression was used to determine whether risk for developing an alcohol use, cannabis use, or other drug use disorder in adulthood increased as exposure to multiple types of adverse childhood experiences increased while controlling for prior substance use and other demographic variables that have shown associations with substance use. In addition, religiosity was investigated as a possible moderator of the relationship between adverse childhood experience and substance abuse. Results: The likelihood of developing a substance use disorder later in life increased as the score on the adverse childhood experience index increased. While religiosity did significantly reduce the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder, no moderating effects were observed. Conclusions/importance: This study underscores the long-term consequences of exposure to childhood adversity.\n",

      "Asthma and infertility are the most common disorders among women of reproductive age. Time to pregnancy is prolonged in women with asthma, and importantly, age seems to be a more important risk factor regarding fertility in women with asthma compared to women without asthma. Some data have shown a higher frequency of miscarriages in women with asthma, although the data are conflicting on this issue as studies have observed no association between asthma and pregnancy loss. Furthermore, studies have shown no negative effect of asthma on the total number of offspring. Pregnancy may, thus, have a significant impact on women with asthma, as well as on their offspring. The age of the women has an important impact on ability to conceive, but also for the pregnancy itself, with higher risk of uncontrolled asthma as well as asthma exacerbations with increasing age. Well-controlled asthma decreases the risk of maternal and fetal complications, while poorly controlled and undertreated asthma is associated with a range of risks for both mother and fetus. Asthma treatment should follow the general guidelines for asthma therapy, irrespective of pregnancy status, including treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, β2-agonists and muscarinic antagonists. Targeted treatment with biologics for severe asthma seems to be without important adverse effects. The use of systemic corticosteroids may be associated with adverse events during the first trimester; however, an exacerbation with the associated risk of hypoxaemia is worse for the fetus. Best possible asthma control may be achieved using repeated measurements of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), as the use of FENO compared with symptoms registration only has been shown to reduce exacerbation rate. In conclusion, women with asthma should be encouraged to conceive at an early age, might experience miscarriages, but the number of offspring are the same as in women without asthma. Well treated asthma is important for the well-being of both the mother and the unborn fetus. Management of asthma in pregnant women with asthma should follow the general guidelines for good clinical practice. Well-controlled asthma throughout pregnancy is the key to avoiding complications during pregnancy and delivery. https://bit.ly/3OHHxF5\n",

      "In the process of screening for pancreatic lipase inhibitors, which could be used as an anti-obesity measure, the methanol extract of Dioscorea nipponica Makino powder (DP) appeared to have potent inhibitory activity against porcine pancreatic lipase with an IC50 value of 5-10 μg/ml, where the enzyme activity was assayed by using 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate as a substrate. Further purification of active components present in the herb generated dioscin that belongs to the saponin family. Dioscin and its aglycone, diosgenin, both suppressed the time-dependent increase of blood triacylglycerol level when orally injected with corn oil to mice, suggesting their inhibitory potential against fat absorption. Sprague-Dawley rats fed on a high-fat diet containing 5% Dioscorea nipponica Makino and 40% beef tallow gained significantly less body weight and adipose tissue than control animals fed on a high-fat diet alone during an 8-week experimental period (P<0.05).\n",

      "Study Design Prospective observational study. Objective Patient-based subjective ratings of symptoms and function have traditionally been used to gauge the success and extent of recovery following spine surgery. The main drawback of this type of assessment is the inherent subjectivity involved in patient scoring. We aimed to objectively measure functional outcome in patients having lumbar spine surgery using quantitative physical activity measurements derived from accelerometers. Methods A prospective study of 30 patients undergoing spine surgery was conducted with subjective outcome scores (visual analog scale [VAS], Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] and Short Form 12 [SF-12]) recorded; patients were given a Fitbit accelerometer (Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, California, United States) at least 7 days in advance of surgery to record physical activity (step count, distance traveled, calories burned) per day. Following surgery, postoperative activity levels were reported at 1-, 2-, and 3-month follow-up. Results Of the 28 compliant patients who completed the full trial period, mean steps taken per day increased 58.2% (p = 0.008) and mean distance traveled per day increased 63% (p = 0.0004) at 3-month follow-up. Significant improvements were noted for mean changes in VAS back pain, VAS leg pain, ODI, and SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores. There was no significant correlation between the improvement in steps or distance traveled per day with improvements in VAS back or leg pain, ODI, or PCS scores at follow-up. Conclusions High compliance and statistically significant improvement in physical activity were demonstrated in patients who had lumbar decompression and lumbar fusion. There was no significant correlation between improvements in subjective clinical outcome scores with changes in physical activity measurements at follow-up. Limitations of the present study include its small sample size, and the validity of objective physical activity measurements should be assessed in future larger, prospective studies.\n",

      "BTB-zinc finger transcription factors play many important roles in metazoan development. In these proteins, the BTB domain is critical for dimerization and for recruiting cofactors to target genes. Identification of these cofactors is important for understanding how BTB-zinc finger proteins influence transcription. Here we show that the novel but conserved protein EOR-2 is an obligate binding partner of the BTB-zinc finger protein EOR-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans. EOR-1 and EOR-2 function together to promote multiple Ras/ERK-dependent cell fates during development, and we show that EOR-1 is a robust substrate of ERK in vitro. A point mutation (L81F) in the EOR-1 BTB domain reduces both ERK phosphorylation and EOR-2 binding and eliminates all detectable biological function without affecting EOR-1 expression levels, localization, or dimerization. This point mutation lies near the predicted charged pocket region of the EOR-1 BTB dimer, a region that, in other BTB-zinc finger proteins, has been proposed to interact with corepressors or coactivators. We also show that a conserved zinc finger-like motif in EOR-2 is required for binding to EOR-1, that the interaction between EOR-1 and EOR-2 is direct, and that EOR-2 can bind to the human BTB-zinc finger protein PLZF. We propose that EOR-2 defines a new family of cofactors for BTB-zinc finger transcription factors that may have conserved roles in other organisms.\n",

      "Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, the aberrant production of the Th2 cytokines, and eosinophil infiltration into the lungs. In this study, we examined the effects of baicalein, wogonin, and Scutellaria baicalensis ethanol extract on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma by evaluating Th1/Th2 cytokine levels, histopathologic analysis, and compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis and mast cell activation, focusing on the histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. Baicalein, wogonin, and S. baicalensis ethanol extract also decreased the number of inflammatory cells especially eosinophils and downregulated peribronchial and perivascular inflammation in the lungs of mice challenged by OVA. Baicalein, wogonin, and S. baicalensis ethanol extract significantly reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-5 and the production of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1, and upregulated the level of interferon-γ and OVA-specific IgG2a. In addition, oral administration of baicalein, wogonin, and S. baicalensis ethanol extract inhibited compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis and plasma histamine release in mice. Moreover, baicalein, wogonin, and S. baicalensis ethanol extract suppressed compound 48/80-induced mast cell degranulation and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. Conclusively, baicalein and wogonin as major flavonoids of S. baicalensis may have therapeutic potential for allergic asthma through modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance and histamine release from mast cells.\n",

      "A variety of cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary sarcoidosis, but the exact roles of IL‐6 and IL‐8 are not yet clear. We studied these cytokine levels in BALF from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systemic screlosis (SSc) with interstitial lung disease and control subjects. IL‐6 and IL‐8 levels were significantly elevated in sarcoidosis, IPF and SSc with interstitial lung disease compared with control subjects. Subjects with sarcoidosis had significantly increased levels of both cytokines compared with controls when the cytokine values were corrected by the total albumin content and the two cytokine levels correlated with each other (r=0.876). BALF IL‐6 levels correlated with percent lymphocytes and percent CD3+ cells. Moreover, when sarcoidosis patients were divided into three groups, those who needed steroid therapy or had progressive disease showed increased cytokine levels in BALF over stable or improved patients. These observations suggest that locally derived IL‐6 and IL‐8 were increased in sarcoidosis and correlated with activity of this granulomatous lung disease.\n",

      "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits and play important roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we have investigated the development of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, a widely used model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and it is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder. For that reason, we investigated synaptic properties and dendritic development in animals from an early stage when synapses are starting to form up to adulthood. We found that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Fmr1-KO mouse exhibit a higher AMPAR-NMDAR ratio early in development but reverses to normal values after P13. This increase was accompanied by a larger presence of the GluA2-subunit in synaptic AMPARs that will lead to altered Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs that could have a profound impact upon neural circuits, learning, and diseases. Following this, we found that young KO animals lack Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-understood model of synaptic plasticity necessary for proper development of circuits, and exhibit an increased frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, a measure of synaptic density. Furthermore, post hoc morphological analysis of recorded neurons revealed altered dendritic branching in the KO group. Interestingly, all these anomalies are transitory and revert to normal values in older animals. Our data suggest that loss of FMRP during early development leads to temporary upregulation of the GluA2 subunit and this impacts synaptic plasticity and altering morphological dendritic branching.\n",

      "To date, the only treatment for celiac disease (CD) consists of a strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD), which has numerous limitations in patients with CD. For this reason, dietary transgressions are frequent, implying intestinal damage and possible long-term complications. There is an unquestionable need for non-dietary alternatives to avoid damage by involuntary contamination or voluntary dietary transgressions. In recent years, different therapies and treatments for CD have been developed and studied based on the degradation of gluten in the intestinal lumen, regulation of the immune response, modulation of intestinal permeability, and induction of immunological tolerance. In this review, therapeutic lines for CD are evaluated with special emphasis on phase III and II clinical trials, some of which have promising results.\n",

      "In vivo imaging is one of the ultimate and fundamental approaches for the study of the brain. Two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) constitutes the state-of-the-art technique in current neuroscience to address questions regarding brain cell structure, development and function, blood flow regulation and metabolism. This technique evolved from laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), which impacted the field with a major improvement in image resolution of live tissues in the 1980s compared to widefield microscopy. While nowadays some of the unparalleled features of 2PLSM make it the tool of choice for brain studies in vivo, such as the possibility to image deep within a tissue, LSCM can still be useful in this matter. Here we discuss the validity and limitations of LSCM and provide a guide to perform high-resolution in vivo imaging of the brain of live rodents with minimal mechanical disruption employing LSCM. We describe the surgical procedure and experimental setup that allowed us to record intracellular calcium variations in astrocytes evoked by sensory stimulation, and to monitor intact neuronal dendritic spines and astrocytic processes as well as blood vessel dynamics. Therefore, in spite of certain limitations that need to be carefully considered, LSCM constitutes a useful, convenient, and affordable tool for brain studies in vivo.\n",

      "Objective: To investigate whether the presence of autoantibodies specific for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is determined by the major genetic susceptibility locus for the disease at the HLA genes, using the T1D Genetics Consortium data. Methods: We analysed anti-IA-2 and anti-GAD 65 autoantibody data from 2282 T1D patients from 1117 multiplex families. HLA genotyping was available for all cases and their parents and association with autoantibody positivity was tested by the transmission disequilibrium test. Results: Association of anti-IA-2 with the HLA genes was detected at high statistical significance. HLA-DRB1*0401 confers both the strongest type 1 diabetes risk, and positive association of anti-IA-2, whereas the DRB1*03- DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype, associated less strongly with T1D, showed a significant negative association with anti-IA-2 positivity. Interestingly, HLA-A*24 is also negatively associated with anti-IA-2, independently of the DRB1*03- DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype. No statistically significant association was identified between anti-GAD65 and HLA. Conclusions: This study highlights that IA-2 as an autoantigen depends on HLA genotype and suggests new insights into the mechanism of loss of immune tolerance.\n",

      "Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and reconstruction (ACLR) promote quadriceps muscle atrophy and weakness that can persist for years, suggesting the need for more effective rehabilitation programs. Whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be used to prevent maladaptations in skeletal muscle size and function is unclear. Purpose: To examine whether early NMES use, started soon after an injury and maintained through 3 weeks after surgery, can preserve quadriceps muscle size and contractile function at the cellular (ie, fiber) level in the injured versus noninjured leg of patients undergoing ACLR. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: Patients (n = 25; 12 men/13 women) with an acute, first-time ACL rupture were randomized to NMES (5 d/wk) or sham (simulated microcurrent electrical nerve stimulation; 5 d/wk) treatment to the quadriceps muscles of their injured leg. Bilateral biopsies of the vastus lateralis were performed 3 weeks after surgery to measure skeletal muscle fiber size and contractility. Quadriceps muscle size and strength were assessed 6 months after surgery. Results: A total of 21 patients (9 men/12 women) completed the trial. ACLR reduced single muscle fiber size and contractility across all fiber types (P < .01 to P < .001) in the injured compared with noninjured leg 3 weeks after surgery. NMES reduced muscle fiber atrophy (P < .01) through effects on fast-twitch myosin heavy chain (MHC) II fibers (P < .01 to P < .001). NMES preserved contractility in slow-twitch MHC I fibers (P < .01 to P < .001), increasing maximal contractile velocity (P < .01) and preserving power output (P < .01), but not in MHC II fibers. Differences in whole muscle strength between groups were not discerned 6 months after surgery. Conclusion: Early NMES use reduced skeletal muscle fiber atrophy in MHC II fibers and preserved contractility in MHC I fibers. These results provide seminal, cellular-level data demonstrating the utility of the early use of NMES to beneficially modify skeletal muscle maladaptations to ACLR. Clinical Relevance: Our results provide the first comprehensive, cellular-level evidence to show that the early use of NMES mitigates early skeletal muscle maladaptations to ACLR.

      "Balance control must be rapidly modified to provide stability in the face of environmental challenges. Although changes in reactive balance over repeated perturbations have been observed previously, only anticipatory postural adjustments preceding voluntary movements have been studied in the framework of motor adaptation and learning theory. Here, we hypothesized that adaptation occurs in task-level balance control during responses to perturbations due to central changes in the control of both anticipatory and reactive components of balance. Our adaptation paradigm consisted of a Training set of forward support-surface perturbations, a Reversal set of novel countermanding perturbations that reversed direction, and a Washout set identical to the Training set. Adaptation was characterized by a change in a motor variable from the beginning to the end of each set, the presence of aftereffects at the beginning of the Washout set when the novel perturbations were removed, and a return of the variable at the end of the Washout to a level comparable to the end of the Training set. Task-level balance performance was characterized by peak center of mass (CoM) excursion and velocity, which showed adaptive changes with repetitive trials. Only small changes in anticipatory postural control, characterized by body lean and background muscle activity were observed. Adaptation was found in the evoked long-latency muscular response, and also in the sensorimotor transformation mediating that response. Finally, in each set, temporal patterns of muscle activity converged towards an optimum predicted by a trade-off between maximizing motor performance and minimizing muscle activity. Our results suggest that adaptation in balance, as well as other motor tasks, is mediated by altering central sensitivity to perturbations and may be driven by energetic considerations.\n",

      "Resident education has changed dramatically over the past 10 years. With the implementation of restricted work hours on clinical training, questions have arisen whether these restricted hours will affect clinical competency. This manuscript attempts to answer this question through a survey performed to assess the perception of residents about duty-hour restrictions and the potential effect on residents’ clinical exposure. In this study, a majority of the respondents did believe that work-week restrictions significantly affected patient care and clinical exposure. However, few respondents were willing to accept an additional year of training to compensate for the loss of this clinical exposure. Regardless, work-hour restrictions are here to stay and will probably be further limited in the future. Training programs will have to adjust to provide the necessary clinical exposure while complying with these new ACGME guidelines.\n",

      "1 We have used 125I‐labelled fibrinogen (I‐FN) in experiments monitoring plasma extravasation from vessels within guinea‐pig trachea and peripheral lung tissue in response to platelet activating factor (PAF) and bradykinin (BK). Retained tissue radioactivity derived from I‐FN was detected by direct measurement and by autoradiography. 2 Both PAF and BK caused concentration‐dependent increases in radioactivity in trachea and peripheral lung, with PAF being approximately 1000 times more potent than BK at both sites. On a wet weight basis, mean tracheal leakage responses to PAF and BK were approximately 6 times and 2 times greater respectively than those in peripheral lung. Furthermore, in trachea, the maximal response to PAF was nearly twice that to BK, although they were approximately equiactive in peripheral lung. The dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor, enalapril (1 mg kg−1, i.v.), increased the potency of BK by approximately 40 fold. 3 In trachea, PAF (50 ng kg−1, i.v.)‐induced leakage was selectively inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist, WEB 2086 (5–50 μg kg−1), while responses to BK (50 μg kg−1, i.v.) were selectively inhibited by the BK2 receptor antagonist NPC 349 (0.5–1 mg kg−1). Neither PAF nor BK‐induced leakage were significantly altered by pretreatment with the histamine H1‐receptor antagonists mepyramine (10 μg kg−1) or ketotifen (50 μg kg−1) or the leukotriene receptor antagonist SKF 104353. These data indicate that both agonists caused direct, specific receptor operated increases in tracheal vascular permeability to plasma macromolecules. The α/β‐adrenoceptor agonist adrenaline (100 μg kg−1) caused modest inhibition of leakage induced by BK, but not of the leakage response to PAF. 4 Peripheral airway leakage responses to both PAF and BK were also detected by light microscopic autoradiography in paraffin‐embedded tissue sections. This was possible since a significant amount of extravasated I‐FN was apparently precipitated and fixed in the extravascular space as 125I‐labelled fibrin. Autoradiograms showed that both agonists caused increases in peripheral bronchial circulation microvascular permeability to I‐FN. No evidence for leakage in alveolar wall capillaries or in pulmonary blood vessels was observed. Quantitation of such autoradiographic data will allow a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of putative asthma mediators on microvascular permeability throughout the respiratory tree.\n",

      "To investigate the unregulated Ras activation associated with cancer, we developed and validated a mathematical model of Ras signaling. The model-based predictions and associated experiments help explain why only one of two classes of activating Ras point mutations with in vitro transformation potential is commonly found in cancers. Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network. This system-level analysis of the oncogenic Ras network provides new insights and potential therapeutic strategies.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:Diagnosing postoperative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in cardiothoracic surgical patients is complicated because of the profound thrombocytopenia that occurs with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CPB predisposes patients to develop a frequent incidence of antibodies directed against platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin complexes and HIT. The sensitivity of readily available antibody immunoassays is high, but specificity is quite low. The use of both a clinical probability score and rapid laboratory immunoassay has been shown to increase specificity, which is of particular importance in the CPB setting. Prompt diagnosis is crucial because cessation of heparin and treatment with alternative anticoagulation can reduce the risk of thromboembolic events. METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed records from cardiothoracic surgical patients whose serum was tested with both the serotonin release assay (SRA) and the PF4/heparin immunoassay from January 2007 through December 2010. We assigned a high, intermediate, or low clinical “4Ts” probability score that quantifies thrombocytopenia, timing of platelet decrease, and thrombotic complications in each patient. We then compared the clinical score and the PF4/heparin immunoassay against the “gold standard” diagnostic test, the SRA. RESULTS:The sensitivity and specificity for PF4/heparin optical density >0.40 were 100% and 26%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HIT with a combination of PF4/heparin optical density >0.40 and high/intermediate 4Ts score were 100% and 70%, respectively. The negative predictive value was 100% for low 4Ts score. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrated that the use of the 4Ts clinical score combined with the PF4/heparin immunoassay for HIT diagnosis increases the sensitivity and specificity of HIT testing compared with the PF4/heparin immunoassay alone. Furthermore, with an intermediate 4Ts score and positive PF4/heparin antibody test, a confirmatory platelet activation assay such as the SRA is necessary. Physicians treating patients after cardiothoracic surgery should recognize the need for an antibody test and confirmation with a platelet activation assay with even moderate clinical probability of HIT.\n",

      "Summary At the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, hospitals and ambulatory surgical centres significantly decreased elective surgical procedures to facilitate capacity for in-hospital beds, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), preserve anesthetic medications and limit spread of infection. Non-COVID-19–related ophthalmic disease continues to affect vision, and it is anticipated that the backlog of elective surgeries will require months to years to resolve. The delivery of ophthalmic surgical care in a prioritized, systematic and transparent way is vital to manage the surgical backlog while minimizing vision loss and consequent disability in the Canadian population. The Canadian Ophthalmology Society (COS) has modified the published Medically Necessary, Time Sensitive (MeNTS) Procedures scoring system to be applicable to all subspecialties within ophthalmology. This case prioritization process integrates medical necessity, consideration of resource preservation with risk of COVID-19 exposure, and factors unique to eye care. It provides guidance to Canadian ophthalmologists to facilitate decision making in triaging elective procedures.\n",

      "Introduction Catheter-related sepsis is one of the most dangerous complications of neonatal intensive care and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Use of catheter-care ‘bundles’ has reduced the incidence of catheter-related sepsis, although individual components have not been well studied. Better evidence is needed to guide selection of the most appropriate antiseptic solution for skin disinfection in preterm neonates. This study will inform the feasibility and design of the first randomised controlled trial to examine the safety and efficacy of alcohol-based versus aqueous-based chlorhexidine antiseptic formulations for skin disinfection prior to percutaneous central venous catheterisation in preterm neonates. The antiseptics to be compared are 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) aqueous and 2% CHG in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Methods and analysis The Antiseptic Randomised Controlled Trial for Insertion of Catheters (ARCTIC) is a two-centre randomised-controlled feasibility trial. At least 100 preterm infants born at <34 weeks’ gestation and due to undergo percutaneous insertion of a central venous catheter will be randomly allocated to receive prior skin disinfection with one of the two antiseptic solutions. Outcomes include: i) recruitment and retention rates; ii) completeness of data collection; iii) numbers of enrolled infants meeting case definitions for definite catheter-related sepsis, catheter-associated sepsis and catheter colonisation and iv) safety outcomes of skin morbidity scores recorded daily from catheter insertion until 48 hours post removal. The key feasibility metrics will be reported as proportions with 95% CIs. Estimated prevalence of catheter colonisation will allow calculation of sample size for the large-scale trial. The data will inform whether it will be feasible to progress to a large-scale trial. Ethics and dissemination ARCTIC has been approved by the National Health Service Health Research Authority National Research Ethics Service Committee East of England (Cambridge South) (IRAS ID 163868), was adopted onto the National Institute of Health Research Clinical Research Network portfolio (CPMS ID 19899) and is registered with an International Standard Randomised Control Trials Number (ISRCTN: 82571474; Pre-results) and European Clinical Trials Database number 2015-000874-36.

      "Major structural cardiovascular diseases are associated with cardiac arrhythmias, but their full spectrum remains unknown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which we addressed in this systematic review. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) prevalence is 16–22% in heart failure, 10–28% in rheumatic heart disease, 3–7% in cardiology admissions, but <1% in the general population. Use of oral anticoagulation is heterogenous (9–79%) across SSA. The epidemiology of sudden cardiac arrest/death is less characterized in SSA. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is challenging, owing to low awareness and lack of equipment for life-support. About 18% of SSA countries have no cardiac implantable electronic devices services, leaving hundreds of millions of people without any access to treatment for advanced bradyarrhythmias, and implant rates are more than 200-fold lower than in the western world. Management of tachyarrhythmias is largely non-invasive (about 80% AF/AFL via rate-controlled strategy only), as electrophysiological study and catheter ablation centers are almost non-existent in most countries. Highlights: - Atrial fibrillation/flutter prevalence is 16–22% in heart failure, 10–28% in rheumatic heart disease, 3–7% in cardiology admissions, and <1% in the general population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). - Rates of oral anticoagulation use for CHA2DS2VASC score ≥2 are very diverse (9–79%) across SSA countries. - Data on sudden cardiac arrest are scant in SSA with low cardiopulmonary resuscitation awareness. - Low rates of cardiac implantable electronic devices insertions and rarity of invasive arrhythmia treatment centers are seen in SSA, relative to the high-income countries.\n",

      "The stable, recessive Arabidopsis variegated 3 (var3) mutant exhibits a variegated phenotype due to somatic areas lacking or containing developmentally retarded chloroplasts and greatly reduced numbers of palisade cells. The VAR3 gene, isolated by transposon tagging, encodes the 85.9 kDa VAR3 protein containing novel repeats and zinc fingers described as protein interaction domains. VAR3 interacts specifically in yeast and in vitro with NCED4, a putative polyene chain or carotenoid dioxygenase, and both VAR3 and NCED4 accumulate in the chloroplast stroma. Metabolic profiling demonstrates that pigment profiles are qualitatively similar in wild type and var3, although var3 accumulates lower levels of chlorophylls and carotenoids. These results indicate that VAR3 is a part of a protein complex required for normal chloroplast and palisade cell development.\n",

      "The anatomy and histology of the olfactory organ of African ostrich chick were carefully observed by gross anatomy observation, paraffin sectioning and haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining. The results showed that there were no keratotic nose lids at the entrance of the external naris, and that the nasal cavity was separated into two imperforate compartments by the nasal septum. The posterior conchae were connected with the middle conchae without cohering to nasal walls, and appeared to be part of a palinal elongation of the middle conchae. Olfactory cells were distributed in the mucosal epithelium of middle and posterior conchae. Nasal glands were shaped like irregular rectangles, and their connective tissue extended to the parenchyma, which was divided into many glandular lobules. The layers of the olfactory bulb were indistinct, the globular structure was inconspicuous and the granular cells were scattered relatively in the lamina granularis externa.\n",

      "Abstract Background One of the most important complications of Kawasaki disease is the development of giant coronary aneurysms. Risk factors for their development are still not clear. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted at the National Institute of Paediatrics in Mexico City, Mexico. It included all patients with a diagnosis of acute Kawasaki disease between August, 1995 and August, 2015. Clinical and laboratory findings, as well as echocardiographic measurements, were recorded. Patients with giant coronary aneurysms (z-score⩾10) were compared with the rest of the patients. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated to define risk factors. Results During the study period, 416 patients were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease. Of them, 34 developed giant coronary aneurysms during the acute stage of the disease. In the multivariate analysis, patients younger than 1 year, those with a higher duration of illness at the time of diagnosis, and those who received additional intravenous immunoglobulin showed a significantly higher frequency of giant coronary aneurysms. Conclusions One of the main factors associated with the development of giant coronary aneurysms was the delay in the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. This finding highlights the importance of maintaining a high suspicion of the disease, which would enable an early diagnosis and prompt treatment and decrease the risk for developing giant coronary aneurysms.\n",

      "ABSTRACT Introduction Despite various treatments available, there is still a high mortality rate in breast cancer patients. Thus, there exists an unmet need for new therapeutic interventions. Studies show that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in breast cancer metastasis because of its transcriptional control on epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Areas covered This comprehensive review explores the Wnt signaling pathway as a potential target for treating breast cancer and other breast cancer subtypes. We discuss the Wnt signaling pathway, its role in breast cancer metastasis, and its effect on breast cancer stem cells. Further, endogenous agents that cause Wnt pathway inactivation are outlined. Finally, various natural and chemical compounds modulating the Wnt pathway used in pre-clinical or clinical trials for breast cancer treatment are discussed. Expert opinion In vitro and in vivo studies indicate an immense potential of agents targeting the Wnt signaling pathway to prevent and manage breast cancer. Still, more clinical studies are required to support their use in humans. Apart from the agents already in clinical trials, several drug combinations discussed may be translated into clinical practice in a few years.\n",

      "Here we present a magnetic recyclable photo-Fenton catalyst CoFe2O4@PPy with uniform morphology and excellent dispersibility prepared via simple in situ Fenton oxidization polymerization. The CoFe2O4 core provides good magnetic recyclability for the catalysts as well as the ion source for catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 in PPy coating. The optimal catalytic effect can be obtained by adjusting the ratio of CoFe2O4 and PPy. Methylene blue, Methyl orange and Rhodamine B (RhB) employed as model pollutants certificated that the catalyst exhibits a wide range of photodegradability. The decoloration rates reach nearly 100% in the photodegradation of 10 mg L−1 RhB after 2 h visible-light irradiation and only low toxicity small molecules are detected by LC-MS. Moreover, the catalytic activity remains after 5 cycles with decoloration rates up to 90%. The degradation measurement in the presence of scavengers of reactive species reveals that the positive holes (h+) and hydroxyl radical (·OH) are the main reactive oxygen species in the CoFe2O4@PPy system. The performance enhancement may be attributed to the combination of improved Fenton activity by coordinated Fe2+ and PPy redox pairs and photo-catalytic activity by broaden adsorption and photo-generated charge separation.\n",

      "Purpose: Drug resistance in malignant gliomas contributes to poor clinical outcomes. We determined the in vitro drug response profiles for 478 biopsy specimens from patients with the following malignant glial histologies: astrocytoma (n = 71), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 39), glioblastoma multiforme (n = 259), oligodendroglioma (n = 40), and glioma (n = 69). Experimental Design: Samples were tested for drug resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), cisplatin, dacarbazine, paclitaxel, vincristine, and irinotecan. Biomarkers associated with drug resistance were detected by immunohistochemistry, including multidrug resistance gene-1, glutathione S-transferase π (GSTP1), O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and mutant p53. Results:In vitro drug resistance in malignant gliomas was independent of prior therapy. High-grade glioblastomas showed a lower level of extreme drug resistance than low-grade astrocytomas to cisplatin (11% versus 27%), temozolomide (14% versus 27%), irinotecan (33% versus 53%), and BCNU (29% versus 38%). A substantial percentage of brain tumors overexpressed biomarkers associated with drug resistance, including MGMT (67%), GSTP1 (49%), and mutant p53 (41%). MGMT and GSTP1 overexpression was independently associated with in vitro resistance to BCNU, whereas coexpression of these two markers was associated with the greatest degree of BCNU resistance. Conclusions: Assessment of in vitro drug response and profiles of relevant tumor-associated biomarkers may assist the clinician in stratifying patient treatment regimens.\n",

      "Background and aims Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers worldwide. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and has an extremely poor prognosis. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker designed to suppress cellular signaling and inhibit cellular growth and is approved in Europe after platinum-based therapy for squamous NSCLC. The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib after platinum-based therapy for squamous NSCLC in France. Methods The study population was based on the LUX-Lung 8 trial that compared afatinib with erlotinib in patients with squamous NSCLC. The analysis was performed from the perspective of all health care funders and affected patients. A partitioned survival model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on progression-free survival and overall survival in the trial. Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct costs were evaluated over a 10-year time horizon. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 4% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Model projections indicated that afatinib was associated with greater life expectancy (0.16 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.094 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) than that projected for erlotinib. The total cost of treatment over a 10-year time horizon was higher for afatinib than erlotinib, EUR12,364 versus EUR9,510, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR30,277 per QALY gained for afatinib versus erlotinib. Sensitivity analyses showed that the base case findings were stable under variation of a range of model inputs. Conclusion Based on data from the LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib was projected to improve clinical outcomes versus erlotinib, with a 97% probability of being cost-effective assuming a willingness to pay of EUR70,000 per QALY gained, after platinum-based therapy in patients with squamous NSCLC in France.\n",

      "The lung is one of the most exposable organs to chemical warfare agents such as sulfur mustard (SM) gas. Airway hyperresponsiveness and lung inflammation are reported in chemical warfare victims. There is no definite treatment for respiratory disorders induced by SM exposure. However, the protective effect of Nigella sativa on inflammatory process was shown. In the present study, the protective effect of Nigella sativa on tracheal responsiveness and lung inflammation of SM exposed guinea pigs was examined. Guinea pigs were exposed to diluent's solution (ethanol, control group), 100 mg/m3 inhaled sulfur mustard (SME group), and SME treated with Nigella sativa, 0.08 g daily (SME+N), n = 6 for each group. Tracheal responsiveness (TR) to methacholine, total white blood cell (WBC) count of lung lavage, and differential WBC were done 14 days post exposure. The weigh of animal were measured at the beginning, middle (day 7), and the end (day 14) of the study. The TR of SM-exposed guinea pigs was significantly (P <.001) and WBC nonsignificantly higher than those of controls. In SME guinea pigs, there was a weight loss but in the case of SME+N guinea pigs, no obvious weight change thought the study was seen. The eosinophl, monocyte, and lympocytes in SME animals were significantly changed compared to control group (P <.001 for all cases). Monocyte, lymphocyte, and neutrophil number were decreased in SME+N group compared to SME animals, which was significant only for neutrophil (P <.05).

      "The development of DNA barcoding (species identification using a standardized DNA sequence), and the availability of recent DNA sequencing techniques offer new possibilities in diet analysis. DNA fragments shorter than 100–150 bp remain in a much higher proportion in degraded DNA samples and can be recovered from faeces. As a consequence, by using universal primers that amplify a very short but informative DNA fragment, it is possible to reliably identify the plant taxon that has been eaten. According to our experience and using this identification system, about 50% of the taxa can be identified to species using the trnL approach, that is, using the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron. We demonstrated that this new method is fast, simple to implement, and very robust. It can be applied for diet analyses of a wide range of phytophagous species at large scales. We also demonstrated that our approach is efficient for mammals, birds, insects and molluscs. This method opens new perspectives in ecology, not only by allowing large‐scale studies on diet, but also by enhancing studies on resource partitioning among competing species, and describing food webs in ecosystems.\n",

      "Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic neglected disease caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis affecting 30 to 100 million people worldwide. Complications, strongly associated with alcoholism, organ transplants, and HTLV-1 virus, often arise due to late diagnosis, frequently leading to patient death. Lack of preemptive diagnosis is not the only difficulty when dealing with this parasite, since there are no gold standard diagnostic techniques, and the ones used have problems associated with sensitivity, resulting in false negatives. Treatment is also an issue as ivermectin and benzimidazoles administration leads to inconsistent cure rates and several side effects. Researching new anti-Strongyloides drugs is a difficult task since S. stercoralis does not develop until the adult stages in Mus musculus (with the exception of SCID mice), the main experimental host model. Fortunately, alternative parasite models can be used, namely, Strongyloides ratti and S. venezuelensis. However, even with these models, there are other complications in finding new drugs, which are associated with specific in vitro assay protocol steps, such as larvae decontamination. In this review, we highlight the challenges associated with new drug search, the compounds tested, and a list of published in vitro assay methodologies. We also point out advances being made in strongyloidiasis diagnosis so far.\n",

Methods Retrospective cohort study including patients initially diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (CP) within a regional integrated healthcare system between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. Imaging reports from these patients were extracted from the electronic medical record system and split into training, validation and implementation datasets. A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm was first developed through the training dataset to identify specific features (atrophy, calcification, pseudocyst, cyst and main duct dilatation) from free-text radiology reports. The validation dataset was applied to validate the performance by comparing against the manual chart review. The developed algorithm was then applied to the implementation dataset. We classified patients with calcification(s) or ≥2 radiographic features as advanced CP. We compared etiology, comorbid conditions, treatment parameters as well as survival between advanced CP and others diagnosed during the study period. Results 6,346 patients were diagnosed with CP during the study period with 58,085 radiology studies performed. For individual features, NLP yielded sensitivity from 88.7% to 95.3%, specificity from 98.2% to 100.0%. A total of 3,672 patients met cohort inclusion criteria: 1,330 (36.2%) had evidence of advanced CP. Patients with advanced CP had increased frequency of smoking (57.8% vs. 43.0%), diabetes (47.6% vs. 35.9%) and underweight body mass index (6.6% vs. 3.6%), all p<0.001. Mortality from pancreatic cancer was higher in advanced CP (15.3/1,000 person-year vs. 2.8/1,000, p<0.001). Underweight BMI (HR 1.6, 95% CL 1.2, 2.1), smoking (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.1, 1.7) and diabetes (HR 1.4, 95% CL 1.2, 1.6) were independent risk factors for mortality. Conclusion Patients with advanced CP experienced increased disease-related complications and pancreatic cancer-related mortality. Excess all-cause mortality was driven primarily by potentially modifiable risk factors including malnutrition, smoking and diabetes.\n",

      "In image‐guided radiotherapy (IGRT) of prostate cancer, delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) often relies on magnetic resonance (MR) because of its good soft‐tissue visualization. Registration of MR and computed tomography (CT) is required in order to add this accurate delineation to the dose planning CT. An automatic approach for local MR‐CT registration of the prostate has previously been developed using a voxel property‐based registration as an alternative to a manual landmark‐based registration. The aim of this study is to compare the two registration approaches and to investigate the clinical potential for replacing the manual registration with the automatic registration. Registrations and analysis were performed for 30 prostate cancer patients treated with IGRT using a Ni‐Ti prostate stent as a fiducial marker. The comparison included computing translational and rotational differences between the approaches, visual inspection, and computing the overlap of the CTV. The computed mean translational difference was 1.65, 1.60, and 1.80 mm and the computed mean rotational difference was 1.51°, 3.93°, and 2.09° in the superior/inferior, anterior/posterior, and medial/lateral direction, respectively. The sensitivity of overlap was 87%. The results demonstrate that the automatic registration approach performs registrations comparable to the manual registration.

This study examines the effect of CD on dialysis efficiency, coagulation, acid-base status, electrolytes, and inflammation in patients in on-line hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF). Methods: 35 patients in OL-HDF were enrolled in a prospective, cross-over study for a 24-week period and two phases alternating CD and acetate dialysate fluid (AD). Parameters on study were predialysis levels of bicarbonate and ionic calcium, reactive C Protein (CRP), and beta-2 microglobulin (B2MG) and postdialysis levels of activated tromboplastine time, bicarbonate, and ionized calcium. Results: No significant differences in coagulation parameters, pH, and predialysis bicarbonate were found. The postdialysis bicarbonate and postdialysis calcium were lower with CD. Dialysis efficiency was greater with CD. Regarding inflammatory parameters, both CRP and B2MG were lower using CD. Conclusion: The use of CD is safe and effective in OL-HDF, and it improves dialysis efficacy, postdialysis alkalosis, and inflammation.\n",

      "In acute stroke management, time is brain, as narrow therapeutic windows for both intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy depend on expedient and specialized treatment. In rural settings, patients are often far from specialized treatment centers. Concurrently, financial constraints, cutting of services and understaffing of specialists for many rural hospitals have resulted in many patients being underserved. Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) provide a valuable prehospital resource to rural and remote settings where patients may not have easy access to in-hospital stroke care. In addition to standard ambulance equipment, the MSU is equipped with the necessary tools for diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke or similar emergencies at the emergency site. The MSU strategy has proven to be effective at facilitating time-saving stroke triage decisions. The additional on-board imaging helps to determine whether a patient should be taken to a primary stroke center (PSC) for standard treatment or to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for advanced stroke treatment (such as intra-arterial therapy) instead. Diagnosis at the emergency site may prevent additional in-hospital delays in workup, handover and secondary (inter-hospital) transport. MSUs may be adapted to local needs—especially in rural and remote settings—with adjustments in staffing, ambulance configuration, and transport models. Further, with advanced imaging and further diagnostic capabilities, MSUs provide a valuable platform for telemedicine (teleradiology and telestroke) in these underserved areas. As MSU programmes continue to be implemented across the world, optimal and adaptable configurations could be explored.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES:Recent studies indicate that colonization with cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains may protect against gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its complications, but the role of cagA in the etiology of Barrett's esophagus has so far been poorly investigated. The pathogenesis of intestinal metaplasia (IM) at an endoscopically normal esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is still unclear, and the role of the H. pylori virulence factor cagA in it has not been investigated. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between H. pylori and cagA-positive H. pylori in particular and IM at an endoscopically normal EGJ and Barrett's esophagus.METHODS:Serum samples were obtained from 62 patients without IM, 43 patients with IM at an endoscopically normal junction, and 51 patients with Barrett's esophagus. IM was defined as presence of goblet cells with positive staining with Alcian blue. The prevalence of H. pylori and cagA was investigated by assessment of IgG antibody levels as determined by ELISA.RESULTS:The overall H. pylori prevalence was 59% (92/156), and the cagA prevalence was 29% (46/156). Although 63% (39/62) of IM negative subjects and 74% (32/43) of those with IM at the junction were H. pylori positive, only 41% (21/51) of Barrett's patients tested positive. The differences between the IM negative and the Barrett's group (p = 0.02) and between IM at the junction and Barrett's were significant (p = 0.002). The relative cagA prevalence (percentage with cagA positivity and H. pylori positivity) was 56% (22/39) in patients who were IM negative, 59% (19/32) in those with IM at the junction, and 24% (5/21) in those with Barrett's. The prevalence of anti-CagA was significantly lower in patients with Barrett's esophagus compared with patients who were IM negative (p = 0.002) and those who had IM at the junction (p < 0.001). No difference in cagA prevalence was seen between the latter groups.CONCLUSIONS:These findings are in line with the concept that H. pylori and cagA-positive strains in particular protect against the development of Barrett's esophagus. In contrast, our findings do not support the theory that IM at an endoscopically normal esophagogastric junction is associated with H. pylori or cagA-positive strains. IM at the junction and Barrett's esophagus seem to have different etiologies.\n",

      "To the Editor Studies carried out during the last decade have largely demonstrated that an activation of the coagulation cascade may be observed in patients with severe chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). 1-3 Such activation occurs mostly via the extrinsic pathway and strictly parallels the activity of the disease. Activated eosinophils, hyper-expressing tissue factor, seem the main initiators of these phenomena, 4 although endothelial cells may concur as well. 5 The potential relevance of thrombin as well as of other activated coagulation factors in amplifying the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils, thus worsening the disease status, is suggested by several studies reporting the efficacy of anticoagulants in patients with severe CSU not responding to antihistamines at any dosage. 3 The humanized anti-IgE mAb, omalizumab, has become a mainstay of the treatment of severe CSU during the last years. Patients’ response to this biological may be very rapid (as short as a few days after the first administration), slow (requiring 3-4 month of therapy), or absent in a minority of patients. Such different pattern of response to omalizumab has prompted possible differences in the pathogenesis of the disease; in effect, recent studies demonstrated the presence of circulating IgE autoantibodies in patients who show a prompt response to the drug, whereas late and nonresponders probably represent a subset characterized by an IgG-mediated autoimmune mechanism directed to the high-affinity IgE receptor of to IgE. 6,7 Although some recent studies found that the levels of the fibrin fragment D-dimer, a biomarker of coagulation activation, parallel the response to omalizumab in patients with CSU, 8 the way these two variables are interconnected each other has not been studied in detail so far. We investigated this aspect in the present study. One hundred sixty-one adult patients (M/F 43/118; mean age 48 ± 16 years, range 15-80 years) with both active and severe CSU (baseline UAS-7 > 20) not responding to second-generation antihistamines at doses up to 4 times higher than the licensed dose and submitted to subcutaneous omalizumab treatment at a dose of 300 mg/month for at least 3 months were studied. Baseline D-dimer plasma levels were measured by ELISA in order to assess the correlation of this biomarker with the disease activity and the response to the drug; levels exceeding 50 ng/mL were considered positive. The clinical response to omalizumab was assessed by UAS-7 recordings and classified as early if it occurred within 4 weeks after the first administration, late (if the response could be observed within 3 months), or absent (no detectable response 1 month after the third administration). The clinical response was defined as complete if UAS-7 showed a reduction of 90% or more, partial if the reduction ranged between 50% and 90%, or absent in the presence of variations < 50% of UAS. Ninety patients (55.9%) showed an early and complete response to omalizumab; their mean baseline D-dimer level was 1186 ± 1199 ng/mL. Twenty-eight patients (17.4%) had a late and complete response; their mean baseline D-dimer level was 892 ± 1045 ng/mL; 20 patients (12.4%) showed a late and partial response and a mean baseline D-dimer level of 988 ± 1762 ng/mL, while 23 patients (14.3%) did not respond to the drug (baseline Ddimer 826 ± 973 ng/mL) (Figure 1 ).

      "The recent introduction of West Nile (WN) virus into the Western Hemisphere has focused considerable attention on this virus as a public health problem. As a result, there have been considerable advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology and phylogeny of WN virus strains from different geographical origins. However, relatively little is known about the virulence phenotypes of these viruses. Human infections with WN virus generally result in a mild, self-limiting, undifferentiated fever. However, recent outbreaks in North America and eastern Europe have been associated with a relatively high percentage (up to 10%) of cases involving potentially fatal neurological manifestations.1 The aim of this study was to systematically compare 19 strains of WN virus (TABLE 1) to determine whether biological differences exist between them that can be correlated with genotype. To facilitate this, we undertook a series of mouse neurovirulence experiments, and compared the ability of these viruses to bind to mouse and human brain tissue membrane receptor preparations (MRPs). In addition, we sequenced a ~500 bp region of the NS5 gene/3′-noncoding region (NCR) junction for comparison with other phylogenetic analyses that used segments of the E protein gene. Viruses were chosen to represent each of the known WN virus lineages: lineage I (primarily European and Middle Eastern isolates, but also isolates from the 1999 New York outbreak and some African isolates); lineage II (which comprises African isolates only); Kunjin (KUN) viruses; and Indian WN virus isolates (antigenically distinct from both lineages I and II).2,3 As has been reported previously with a smaller group of WN viruses,3 considerable variation was observed in the region of the 3′-NCR immediately following the\n",

      "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a cardiovascular condition with a multifactorial pathophysiology that includes atherosclerotic plaques, platelet activation and thrombin production, among others. Thrombin production and the prothrombotic state of ACS patients have provided a role for anticoagulants to treat patients during the acute event and has led to subsequent research for the post-acute state. Warfarin has an indication for ACS, however, it is restricted to specific patients and many factors limit its use. Therefore, novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are being explored for ACS. Limitations for the use of NOACs in ACS are centered on the increased risk of bleeding that occurs when these agents are added to the current standard of care with dual antiplatelet therapy. Rivaroxaban is the only NOAC that has achieved approval in Europe for this indication with none of the NOAC currently approved in the US for use in ACS. Ongoing studies for rivaroxaban and apixaban may provide evidence to further clarify the place in therapy for NOAC agents in ACS management.\n",

      "Campylobacter concisus is an emerging pathogen of the human gastrointestinal tract. Its role in different diseases remains a subject of debate; this may be due to strain to strain genetic variation. Here, we sequence and analyze the genome of a C. concisus from a biopsy of a child with Crohn's disease (UNSWCD); the second such genome for this species. A 1.8 Mb genome was assembled with paired-end reads from a next-generation sequencer. This genome is smaller than the 2.1 Mb C. concisus reference BAA-1457. While 1593 genes were conserved across UNSWCD and BAA-1457, 138 genes from UNSWCD and 281 from BAA-1457 were unique when compared against the other. To further validate the genome assembly and annotation, comprehensive shotgun proteomics was performed. This confirmed 78% of open reading frames in UNSWCD and, importantly, provided evidence of expression for 217 proteins previously defined as ‘hypothetical’ in Campylobacter. Substantial functional differences were observed between the UNSWCD and the reference strain. Enrichment analysis revealed differences in membrane proteins, response to stimulus, molecular transport and electron carriers. Synteny maps for the 281 genes not present in UNSWCD identified seven functionally associated gene clusters. These included one associated with the CRISPR family and another which encoded multiple restriction endonucleases; these genes are all involved in resistance to phage attack. Many of the observed differences are consistent with UNSWCD having adapted to greater surface interaction with host cells, as opposed to BAA-1457 which may prefer a free-living environment.\n",

Design We conducted a community-based cross-sectional epidemiological study. Setting The study was conducted in a shantytown in the city of Dhaka. There were 8604 households with 34 170 residents in the community. Those households were categorised into two wealth strata based on the housing structure. Participants The study targeted residents aged 18–64 years. A total of 2986 eligible households with one eligible individual were selected by simple random sampling stratified by household wealth status. A total of 2551 residents completed the questionnaire survey, and 2009 participated in the subsequent physical and biochemical measurements. Outcome measures A modified WHO survey instrument was used for assessing behavioural risk factors and physical and biochemical measurements, including glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). The prevalence of NCD risk factors, such as tobacco use, fruit and vegetable intake, overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes (HbA1c ≥6.5%) and dyslipidaemia, was described according to household wealth status and gender differences. Results The prevalence of current tobacco use was 60.4% in men and 23.5% in women. Most of them (90.8%) consumed more than 1 serving of fruits and vegetables per day; however, only 2.1% consumed more than 5 servings. Overweight/obesity was more common in women (39.2%) than in men (18.9%), while underweight was more common in men (21.0%) than in women (7.1%). The prevalence of hypertension was 18.6% in men and 20.7% in women. The prevalence of diabetes was 15.6% in men and 22.5% in women, which was much higher than the estimated national prevalence (7%). The prevalence of raised total cholesterol (≥190 mg/dL) was 25.7% in men and 34.0% in women. Conclusion The study identified that tobacco use, both overweight and underweight, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were prevalent among the urban poor in Bangladesh.\n",

      "Background/Aim: Chemotherapy with docetaxel (DTX) is used for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but it is inadequate. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the effect of the combination treatment DTX and the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus (TEM) in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, by focusing on the induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Results: TEM induced autophagy but not apoptosis even at a high dose, whereas DTX induced apoptosis. The combination of low-dose DTX and TEM caused a 34% suppression in cell proliferation compared to monotherapy with a higher dose of DTX. The induction of apoptosis was increased by their combination. The combination with DTX overcame the induction of autophagy by TEM. The combination treatment suppressed tumor growth 72% less than the control group after 14 days of treatment in vivo. Conclusion: The combination of TEM and DTX induced apoptosis by overcoming autophagy and enhanced the anticancer effect compared to monotherapy.\n",

These specimens represent an incredible mine of valuable clinical and biological information for proteomic investigation. MALDI‐TOF imaging MS (MALDI‐IMS) is a protein profiling technique which enables the direct sampling of histological section; however, the quality of molecular data are strongly influenced by the tissue preparation condition. In fact, in previous years most of the studies employing such a technological platform have been conducted using cryo‐preserved tissues. We have developed an in vitro approach using “tissue surrogate” samples in order to explore different protein unlocking procedures which might enable a suitable recovery of polypeptides for MS analysis. The developed protocols have been compared both by MALDI‐TOF MS and nLC‐MSE analysis either on surrogate samples or on FFPE specimen from human breast cancer. The collected evidence has been applied for the preparation of FFPE tissue sections following MALDI‐IMS analysis. Our results outline the possibility to obtain valuable peptide mass spectra profiles form FFPE preparations by applying a combined two steps procedure of heat induced antigen retrieval (HIAR) in presence of EDTA and on target trypsin hydrolysis.

      "Strong hippocampal mossy fiber synapses are thought to function as detonators, imposing ‘teaching’ signals onto CA3 neurons during new memory formation. For an empirical test of this long-standing view, we examined effects of stimulating mossy fibers on spatial firing of CA3 neurons in freely-moving mice. We found that optogenetic stimulation of mossy fibers can alter CA3 spatial firing, but their effects are only transient. Spatially restricted mossy fiber stimulation, either congruent or incongruent with CA3 place fields, was more likely to suppress than enhance CA3 neuronal activity. Also, changes in spatial firing induced by optogenetic stimulation reverted immediately upon stimulation termination, leaving CA3 place fields unaltered. Our results do not support the traditional view that mossy fibers impose teaching signals onto CA3 network, and show robustness of established CA3 spatial representations.\n",

      "Summary The effect of enclothelin-l (ET-1) on thrombus formation in vivo was evaluated in two well-established canine models of coronary artery thrombosis. First, the possible antithrombotic effect of ET-1 was examined using the cyclic flow reduction (CFR) model of coronary artery stenosis, vascular endothelial cell and intimal smooth muscle cell injury, and periodic acute platelet thrombus formation. Using a rating system of 0 (no inhibition) to 3 (complete inhibition), ET-1 administration at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/kg, i.v. bolus, produced scores of 1.0 ± 0.2 (n = 10), 1.8 ± 0.4 (n = 8), and 2.1 ± 0.3 (n = 7), respectively. ET-1 injection inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by ADP and U-46619 by 30-60%. When aspirin was administered at 5 mg/kg prior to ET-1 administration at 0.5 pg/kg, ET-1 produced a CFR rating of 2.7 ± 0.2 (n = 6). However, higher dose aspirin (30 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly inhibited the antithrombotic effect of ET-1 (0.5 ± 0.5, n = 4). The antithrombotic effect of ET-1 was also examined using an electrolytic injury model of arterial thrombosis. The time required to produce an occlusive thrombus during the experiments in which ET-1 was administered at 10 and 20 ng kg-1 min-1 was 77 ± 15 (p <0.08) and 105 ± 16 min (p <0.05), respectively, compared to 44 ± 5 min when vehicle was infused. Cardiovascular changes following occlusion were not significantly different between dogs given ET-1 and those given vehicle, suggesting that elevated plasma levels of ET-1 did not exacerbate the adverse effects of coronary occlusion. In addition, plasma ET-1 levels were elevated significantly after occlusion in the dogs given vehicle (from 7.4 to 12.4 pg/ml). Taken together, these data provide further evidence to support the notion that ET-1 release during ischemia may be involved in a protective mechanism that impedes thrombus formation in the stenosed coronary artery.\n",

      "Synovial joints suffer from arthritis and trauma that may be severely debilitative. Despite robust investigations in the roles of individual genes in synovial joint development and arthritis, little is known about global profiles of genes that regulate stem/progenitor cells of a synovial joint. The temporomandibular joint is a poorly understood synovial arthrosis with few clinical treatment options. Here, we isolated the articular and mature zones of the mandibular condyle by laser capture microdissection, performed genome-wide profiling, and analyzed molecular signaling pathways relevant to stem/progenitor cell functions. A total of 804 genes were differentially expressed between the articular and mature zones. Pathway analyses revealed 29 enriched signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt, Wnt, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways that may regulate stem/progenitor cell homeostasis and differentiation into the chondrocyte lineage. Upstream regulator analyses further predicted potential upstream key regulators such as Xbp1, Nupr1, and Hif1a, and associated underlying mechanism networks were described. Among the multiple candidates of growth and transcriptional factors that may regulate stem/progenitor cells, we immunolocalized Sox9, Ihh, Frzb, Dkk1, Lgr5, and TGFβ3 in the articular and mature zones. These findings provide a comprehensive genetic mapping of growth and transcriptional genes in the articular and mature zones of a synovial joint condyle. Differentially expressed genes may play crucial roles in the regulation of stem/progenitor cells in development, homeostasis, and tissue regeneration.\n",

      "MADAM, We read with great interest the study by Gazerani et al. who found that botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) reduces histamine-induced itch and suggested that this treatment may be useful for some pruritic conditions that can be difficult to treat with conventional therapies. Localized pruritus with tingling or burning sensations without signs of a primary skin disease is often due to nerve damage. Neuropathic itch may be due to nerve root impingement, entrapment of peripheral nerves or damage to sensory nerve fibres in the skin. Many patients with neuropathic pruritus respond to topical capsaicin treatment depleting neurotransmitters from sensory nerve fibres, but some patients are difficult to treat. We report our experience of BTX-A in neuropathic pruritus. Four patients with notalgia paraesthetica, one with meralgia paraesthetica and one with neuropathic itch on the upper foot gave their written consent and the study was approved by the Lund University Ethics Committee (Table 1). All but one (patient 2) had tried topical capsaicin 0Æ025% and ⁄or cutaneous field stimulation (CFS) treatment without sustained effects. The intensity of pruritus prior to the BTX-A treatment was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). In each case the itchy area was demarcated through questioning and physical examination. The injection points were marked 1Æ5 cm apart, and 0Æ8–1Æ4 U of BTX-A was injected intracutaneously into each point, using a 3-mL dilution with nonpreserved (0Æ9%) saline (Fig. 1). The treatment was given on one occasion and the patients received a total of 18–100 U of BTX-A, depending on the size of the itchy patch. The patients were followed up by telephone 2 weeks after treatment and through an examination 6 weeks after treatment. Pruritus was assessed using VAS. On injection of BTX-A, all patients reported a sensation of moderate stinging, but otherwise the treatment was well tolerated without any side-effects. Five of six patients noticed improvement of itch 1 week after the treatment, but the evaluation 6 weeks after the treatment indicated a mean reduction of VAS by 28% (Table 1). The two patients reporting improvement after 6 weeks were followed up 18 months later: one (patient 1) reported a VAS of 45%, while the other (patient 2) was still free from itch. In their experimental study, Gazerani et al. injected 5 U of BTX-A, which reduced histamine-induced itch from 40% to 25%, while saline had no effect on itch. However, such a reduction in itch is probably not satisfactory enough in a clinical setting. A mean improvement of 28% in our study is comparable with what can be expected from placebo. This accords with the individual evaluation of our patients, where four of six considered the outcome to be no improvement of itch. The mean dose of BTX-A given in our study was 1 U cm which is comparable with doses used in previous studies reporting successful treatment of notalgia paraesthetica, lichen simplex and postherpetic pain. Weinfeld used approximately 1 U cm for treatment of notalgia paraesthetica while Heckmann et al. used doses corresponding to 1Æ4 U cm of BTX-A for treatment of itch of lichen simplex. Sotiriou et al. used 100 U to treat one or two painful dermatomes in postherpetic neuralgia, but the amount given subcutaneously in cm was not reported. In a study of diabetic C-fibre neuropathy, intradermal BTX-A at 0Æ5 U cm was successful in relieving pain. On the other hand, Krämer et al. found that BTX-A, given intracutaneously at doses of 1Æ25–5 U cm, had almost no effect on experimental hyperalgesia induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation in human skin. It has been shown that intradermal and subcutaneous administration of BTX-A acts on C-fibres, reducing release of neuropeptides, probably through transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)-1 receptors, the targets of capsaicin. In five of our patients, both capsaicin and several other therapies had previously failed. The only patient who fully responded to BTX-A (patient 2) was the one who did not try capsaicin on the present itchy patch, and her symptoms were also of relatively short duration. This finding may suggest that BTX-A and capsaicin share the same target (TRPV-1) and that patients unresponsive to capsaicin will probably not respond to BTX-A. Patient 5 who did not respond satisfactorily to BTX-A had not tried capsaicin but she had had CFS, that, like capsaicin, stimulates sensory nerve fibres. This treatment was, however, not effective either. One advantage of intradermal BTX-A treatment of notalgia paraesthetica compared with capsaicin is that it is administered by a care provider on one or a few occasions instead of daily applications for several weeks on the scapula which the patient has difficulty reaching. Although the effects were limited and for the most part transient, our subjective impression is that BTX-A may become a useful treatment for localized neuropathic itch.

      "Fishes exhibit the greatest diversity of species among vertebrates, offering a number of relevant models for genetic and evolutionary studies. The investigation of sex chromosome differentiation is a very active and striking research area of fish cytogenetics, as fishes represent one of the most vital model groups. Neotropical fish species show an amazing variety of sex chromosome systems, where different stages of differentiation can be found, ranging from homomorphic to highly differentiated sex chromosomes. Here, we draw attention on the impact of recent developments in molecular cytogenetic analyses that helped to elucidate many unknown questions about fish sex chromosome evolution, using excellent characiform models occurring in the Neotropical region, namely the Erythrinidae family and the Triportheus genus. While in Erythrinidae distinct XY and/or multiple XY-derived sex chromosome systems have independently evolved at least four different times, representatives of Triportheus show an opposite scenario, i.e., highly conserved ZZ/ZW system with a monophyletic origin. In both cases, recent molecular approaches, such as mapping of repetitive DNA classes, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and whole chromosome painting (WCP), allowed us to unmask several new features linked to the molecular composition and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes in fishes.\n",

      "Introduction: The TaTME surgery has been developed to overcome the difficulties encountered in the practice of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, especially in male, obese patients with a narrow pelvis and mid and low rectal tumours. Although the TaTME shows some promising results regarding oncological and operative outcomes, some pitfalls have been indicated. Thus, the real benefits of this novel technique over the laparoscopic surgery remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the currently available literature on the outcomes of TaTME in comparison with laparoscopic procedure. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using the web-based databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL, followed by a manual search of the references of the initially identified articles. The study information, patient characteristics, oncological outcomes, perioperative outcomes, as well as short- and long-term postoperative outcomes were collected and critically evaluated. Results: Nine retrospective cohort studies were identified, comprising 751 patients (348 with TaTME, 403 with LaTME). The positive circumferential resection margin (P = 0.01) was better in patients treated with TaTME; whereas the quality of mesorectum, circumferential resection margin, distal resection margin, and harvested lymph nodes were comparable. The TaTME was associated with shorter operative time (P = 0.05; P = 0.0006 in subgroup analysis), less blood loss (P = 0.02), less conversion (P = 0.007), and shorter hospital stay (P = 0.06; P = 0.003 in subgroup analysis). The intraoperative complications were similar. As for the postoperative outcomes, the overall postoperative complications (P = 0.02) and the readmission (P = 0.003) were found less in patients treated with TaTME; however, the individual postoperative complications were found comparable. Conclusion: The present systematic review and meta-analysis suggested some advantages of TaTME, in terms of circumferential resection margin involvement, operative time, blood loss, conversion, hospital stay, overall postoperative complications, and readmission. It appears that the TaTME procedure achieved a better resection quality and smoother recovery in selected patients, without compromising the short-term safety. Nevertheless, it is too early to draw any conclusion, since results of high quality clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials have to be awaited. As it is technically demanding, the procedure needs to be taught and learned systematically to ensure safe implementation.\n",

      "Since 2009, the U.S. Veterans Administration has made concentrated efforts to end homelessness among veterans. As part of these efforts, the Iowa City, Iowa, VA Health Care System in collaboration with local community providers deployed a supportive housing program aimed at homeless veterans. Called the Lodge program, it is intended to serve a Mid-Western mid-size city and its surrounding rural communities. This article presents qualitative findings from a mixed-method, two-year formative evaluation of the Lodge’s implementation. Primary barriers to the effectiveness of the Lodge program were regulations hindering cooperation between service programs, followed by problems regarding information sharing and client substance abuse. Facilitators included personal communication and cooperation between individuals within and among service groups. The feasibility of implementing a Lodge program in a more rural community than Iowa City was also discussed.\n",

      "A number of paradoxes are apparent in the assessment and treatment of psychophysiological insomnia and sleep state misperception. Three of these paradoxes exist as discrepancies between polysomnographic (PSG) measures and the subjective impressions regarding sleep quality and quantity. The remaining incongruity exists largely within the objective domain. In the case of subjective–objective discrepancies, patients with insomnia: (1) frequently identify themselves as having been awake when awakened from PSG defined sleep; (2) tend to overestimate sleep latency and underestimate total sleep time as compared with PSG measures; (3) appear to derive more benefit from pharmacotherapy that can be explained by objective gains. The remaining paradox pertains to the observation that hypnotic medications, by and large, do not normalize sleep architecture or produce a more ‘sleep‐like’ EEG. In this paper, we review possible explanations for these various paradoxes, introduce a new perspective and suggest possible research avenues. The model introduced is based on the observation that beta and/or gamma activity (which have been found to be associated with cognitive processes) is enhanced in insomnia at or around sleep onset. We propose that this kind of high frequency EEG activity may interfere with the normal establishment of sleep onset‐related mesograde amnesia. As a result, the patient with insomnia maintains a level of information and/or memory processing that blurs the phenomenological distinction between sleep and wakefulness and influences retrospective judgments about sleep initiation and duration.\n",

      "Data on how the immune system reacts to decellularized scaffolds after implantation is scarce and difficult to interpret due to many heterogeneous parameters such as tissue-type match, decellularization method and treatment application. The engraftment of these scaffolds must prove safe and that they remain inert to the recipient’s immune system to enable successful translational approaches and potential future clinical evaluation. Herein, we investigated the immune response after the engraftment of three decellularized scaffold types that previously showed potential to repair a uterine injury in the rat. Protocol (P) 1 and P2 were based on Triton-X100 and generated scaffolds containing 820 ng mg−1 and 33 ng mg−1 donor DNA per scaffold weight, respectively. Scaffolds obtained with a sodium deoxycholate-based protocol (P3) contained 160 ng donor DNA per mg tissue. The total number of infiltrating cells, and the population of CD45+ leukocytes, CD4+ T-cells, CD8a+ cytotoxic T-cells, CD22+ B-cells, NCR1+ NK-cells, CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were quantified on days 5, 15 and 30 after a subcutaneous allogenic (Lewis to Sprague Dawley) transplantation. Gene expression for the pro-inflammatory cytokines INF-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF were also examined. P1 scaffolds triggered an early immune response that may had been negative for tissue regeneration but it was stabilized after 30 d. Conversely, P3 initiated a delayed immune response that appeared negative for scaffold survival. P2 scaffolds were the least immunogenic and remained similar to autologous tissue implants. Hence, an effective decellularization protocol based on a mild detergent was advantageous from an immunological perspective and appears the most promising for future in vivo uterus bioengineering applications.\n",

      "Background The progress of information and technology contributes to the increasingly easier access to pornographic content. Adolescents as the highest Internet accessor become the most susceptible population to pornographic hazards, which has an impact on the deviant sexual behavior. This study aimed to identify the relationship of exposure history and pornography addiction to risky sexual behavior in adolescents. Design and Methods The data were collected online using a cross-sectional approach and involved 394 students selected by stratified random sampling. This study used early detection of pornography addiction instrument and Sexual Risk Survey (SRS). Results A significant relationship was found between risky sexual behavior in students and the age of the first-time exposure to pornography (p=0.013), pornographic materials accessed (p=0.041), and the reasons for watching pornography (p=0.017). The higher the degree of pornography addiction, the higher the risky sexual behavior in students (p=0.000; r=0.241). Conclusions A prevention and intervention program are necessary to address the pornography addiction problem as well as the development of various strategic plans in handling issues associated with risky sexual behavior in adolescence.\n",

      "Purpose: Efficient strategies to screen promising agents in early phase development are essential for rapid progress in breast cancer chemoprevention. We report our experience with the natural compound perillyl alcohol (POH) administered in a short-term surrogate end point biomarker (SEB) protocol, using the “window” between diagnostic and definitive surgery. Experimental Design: Eligible patients included those with a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma (<3 cm in size) that required further surgery. Thirty-seven of 267 women screened were enrolled in the study (14%). Five women received single-dose POH (1.5 g/m2) 2 days before surgery, 16 received escalating doses of POH (1.2 g/m2 to 4.8 g/m2/day) for 2 days before surgery, and 16 served as untreated controls. Exploratory SEB analysis [estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, proliferation, apoptosis, M6P/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2R, IGF1, IGF2 and transforming growth factor β] was conducted before and after POH. Results: Only a small portion of the population screened entered the study. Reasons for nonparticipation included protocol ineligibility, conflict of timing of surgery, miscellaneous logistical reasons, or patient’s choice. POH administration was well tolerated and did not interfere with surgical management. The power to observe changes in candidate SEB was diminished by a 44% incidence of cases in which the index lesion was not present in the definitive surgical specimen. Conclusions: Preoperative POH exposure was safe and suitable for a more definitive phase II SEB study. Further investigations must overcome logistical obstacles to accrual, and they must focus on approaches to maximize tissue collection and to incorporate genomic analysis of target lesions.\n",

      "Nuclear export of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA is mediated by a specific RNA element but, in contrast to lentivirus genomic RNA, does not depend on viral proteins. We show that nonetheless, the export of HBV RNA can be blocked by competitive inhibitors of Rev-mediated lentivirus RNA export, suggesting that the export pathways of both viral species share components and might be driven by the same nuclear export machinery. HBV RNA export is also inhibited by overexpression of IkappaB alpha, as reported previously for the export of human immunodeficiency virus RNA. Since IkappaB alpha is strongly overexpressed during liver regeneration, its inhibition of HBV RNA export might contribute to elimination or silent persistence of HBV.\n",

      "The importance of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV‐6) species as human pathogens is increasingly appreciated. However, we do not understand how infection is controlled in healthy virus carriers, and why control fails in patients with disease. Other persistent viruses are under continuous surveillance by antigen‐specific T cells, and specific T‐cell repertoires have been well characterized for some of them. In contrast, knowledge on HHV‐6‐specific T‐cell responses is limited, and missing for CD8+ T cells. Here we identify CD8+ T‐cell responses to HHV‐6B, the most widespread HHV‐6 species, in healthy virus carriers. HHV‐6B‐specific CD8+ T‐cell lines and clones recognized HLA‐A2‐restricted peptides from the viral structural proteins U54 and U11, and displayed various antigen‐specific antiviral effector functions. These CD8+ T cells specifically recognized HHV‐6B‐infected primary CD4+ T cells in an HLA‐restricted manner, produced antiviral cytokines, and killed infected cells, whereas HHV‐6A‐infected cells were not recognized. Thus, HHV‐6B‐specific CD8+ T cells are likely to contribute to control of infection, overcoming the immunomodulatory effects exerted by the virus. Potentially, HHV‐6‐associated disease could be addressed by active or passive immunotherapy that reconstitutes virus‐specific CD8+ T‐cell responses.\n",

      "Obesity is recognized as a major health problem worldwide. Genetic factors play a major role in obesity, and genomewide association studies have provided evidence that several common variants within the fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene are significantly associated with obesity. Very limited data is available on FTO in the Italian population. Aims of our study are to investigate: (1) the association of FTO gene SNPs rs9939609 and rs9930506 with body mass index (BMI) and obesity-related parameters in a large cohort (n = 752) of Italian obese subjects; (2) the association between the two FTO SNPs and age of onset of obesity. Our results demonstrate a strong association between FTO SNPs rs9939609 (P < 0.043) and rs9930506 (P < 0.029) with BMI in the Italian population. FTO rs9930506 was significantly associated with higher BMI in a G allele dose-dependent manner (BMI + 1.4 kg/m2 per G allele). We also observed that the association with BMI of the two FTO variants varied with age, with the carriers of the risk alleles developing an increase in body weight earlier in life. In conclusion, our study further demonstrates a role of the genetic variability in FTO on BMI in a large Italian population.\n",

      "Objective: To explore the recovery pattern of the high-frequency acceleration vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function in unilateral vestibular neuritis (UVN). Methods: Forty-seven consecutive patients with UVN were recruited within 10 days of symptom onset for this study. The high-frequency acceleration horizontal VOR function was assessed using the video head impulse test (vHIT). Patients returned for follow-up evaluation at ~6 months after the onset of symptoms. According to the dizziness handicap inventory questionnaire (DHI), the patients were classified into the normal to mild dizziness group (DHI score ≤30) and moderate to severe dizziness group (DHI score >30) at the follow-up. All the obtained horizontal vHIT gains and corrective saccades parameters were analyzed. Results: vHIT results showed a significantly horizontal VOR gain recovery in UVN patients at the follow-up on the lesion side (p < 0.01). A significantly reduction in the occurrence of corrective saccades (overt and covert) and velocity of corrective saccades (overt and covert) were observed at the follow-up (p < 0.05). At the follow-up, the normal to mild dizziness group (DHI score ≤30) had a significantly higher normal rate of VOR gain, the mean vHIT gains and occurrence of isolated covert saccades (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the occurrence of mixed saccades and the mean velocity of covert saccades were significantly lower in normal to mild dizziness group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Apart from the recovery of the VOR gain, recovery pattern of corrective saccades can play a key role in vestibular compensate.\n",

Results. Fourteen subjects were randomized; mean age was 24.4 ± 11.8 years. At baseline the physical HRQoL score was significantly less (24.2 ± 49.5) but the psychosocial score was similar to the population norm (49.5 ± 10.0). There were significant improvements in most HRQoL concepts after rilonacept but not placebo.

      "Background and Purpose— Hospitalization as a result of stroke provides an opportunity to stop smoking that is often not taken up. The present study analyzes sociodemographic, psychological, and lesion-related variables to identify associated factors for smoking cessation during the first year after stroke. Methods— We conducted a prospective longitudinal study with a 1-year follow-up of a cohort of 110 patients with acute stroke who were smokers at the time of diagnosis and were admitted consecutively between January 2005 and July 2007. Results— On hospital release, 69.1% had given up smoking but at 1 year, only 40% had stopped smoking. Of the 110 patients, 27 (24.5%) had an acute stroke lesion in the insular cortex, of which 19 (70.3%) were nonsmokers at 1 year. Strongly associated factors in giving up smoking were the location of the lesion in the insular cortex (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 1.95–15.01; P=0.001) and having the intention of giving up before the stroke, comparing precontemplating patients (without intention of giving up in the near future) with contemplating and prepared patients (intention of stopping in the near future; OR, 7.29; 95% CI, 1.89–28.07; P=0.004). Conclusions— Of patients with stroke who were smokers, only 4 of 10 patients had stopped smoking 1 year after admission. Our results show that the variables best predicting smoking cessation in patients with a stroke diagnosis 1 year after hospital discharge are insular damage and the prestroke intention to stop.\n",

      "Abstract Background Venules have been usually neglected in the literature on lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA). The aim of this study was to analyze the flow dynamic of recipient venules in LVA and their impact on the surgical outcomes. Patients and Methods Data from 128 patients affected by extremity lymphedema, who underwent LVA, were collected in two institutions from August 2014 to May 2016. Recipient venules were classified according to their flow dynamic into backflow, slack, and outlet (BSO classification). Quantitative (lower extremity lymphedema/upper extremity lymphedema index) and qualitative outcomes (needing of compression garment and compression garment class) were evaluated. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables and independent-samples t-test for continuous variables. The association between lymphatic collector degeneration status (normal, ectasis, contractile, sclerotic type [NECST]) and BSO classification with the outcomes was analyzed by the Mantel–Haenszel test. Results On a total of 128 patients, 37 suffered from upper and 91 from lower limb lymphedema. An average number of four LVA were performed for each patient (range: 2–8). A significant association was observed between NECST and BSO categories and the outcomes were evaluated. Patients with contractile and sclerotic collectors had 2.24 times the odd of having poor composite outcome compared with those with normal-to-ectasis collectors (p < 0.05). Patients with backflow venules had 3.32 times the odd of having poor composite outcome compared with those without outlet or slack pattern (p < 0.05). Conclusion The subtype of recipient venule flow dynamic has a significant impact on the surgical outcome of patients undergoing LVA for the treatment of lymphedema, regardless of the lymphatic collector degeneration status. Locating favorable venules in the preoperative mapping might enhance the surgical outcomes.\n",

      "Objective In global health considerable attention is focused on the search for innovations; however, reports tracking their adoption in routine hospital settings from low-income countries are absent. Design and setting We used data collected on a consistent panel of indicators during four separate cross-sectional, hospital surveys in Kenya to track changes over a period of 11 years (2002–2012). Main outcome measures Basic resource availability, use of diagnostics and uptake of recommended practices. Results There appeared little change in availability of a panel of 28 basic resources (median 71% in 2002 to 82% in 2012) although availability of specific feeds for severe malnutrition and vitamin K improved. Use of blood glucose and HIV testing increased but remained inappropriately low throughout. Commonly (malaria) and uncommonly (lumbar puncture) performed diagnostic tests frequently failed to inform practice while pulse oximetry, a simple and cheap technology, was rarely available even in 2012. However, increasing adherence to prescribing guidance occurred during a period from 2006 to 2012 in which efforts were made to disseminate guidelines. Conclusions Findings suggest changes in clinical practices possibly linked to dissemination of guidelines at reasonable scale. However, full availability of basic resources was not attained and major gaps likely exist between the potential and actual impacts of simple diagnostics and technologies representing problems with availability, adoption and successful utilisation. These findings are relevant to debates on scaling up in low-income settings and to those developing novel therapeutic or diagnostic interventions.\n",

      "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is dependent on microRNA 122 (miR-122), a liver-specific microRNA that recruits Argonaute 2 to the 5′ end of the viral genome, stabilizing it and slowing its decay both in cell-free reactions and in infected cells. Here we describe the RNA degradation pathways against which miR-122 provides protection. Transfected HCV RNA is degraded by both the 5′ exonuclease Xrn1 and 3′ exonuclease exosome complex, whereas replicating RNA within infected cells is degraded primarily by Xrn1 with no contribution from the exosome. Consistent with this, sequencing of the 5′ and 3′ ends of RNA degradation intermediates in infected cells confirmed that 5′ decay is the primary pathway for HCV RNA degradation. Xrn1 knockdown enhances HCV replication, indicating that Xrn1 decay and the viral replicase compete to set RNA abundance within infected cells. Xrn1 knockdown and miR-122 supplementation have equal, redundant, and nonadditive effects on the rate of viral RNA decay, indicating that miR-122 protects HCV RNA from 5′ decay. Nevertheless, Xrn1 knockdown does not rescue replication of a viral mutant defective in miR-122 binding, indicating that miR-122 has additional yet uncharacterized function(s) in the viral life cycle.\n",

      "Background: Cause and pathogenesis of the Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS), a recurrent hypersomnia affecting mainly male adolescents, remain unknown, with only scant information on the sleep characteristics during episodes. We describe findings obtained with polysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and correlation obtained between clinical and PSG findings from different episodes. Method: Nineteen patients (17 male) were investigated with PSG and MSLT. Ten patients had data during both symptomatic episode and asymptomatic interval. The analyses considered day of onset of symptoms and relationship between this time of onset and day of recording during the symptomatic period. Results: When PSG was performed early (before the end of the first half of the symptomatic period), an important reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS) was always present with progressive return to normal during the second half (with percentages very similar to those monitored during the asymptomatic period) despite persistence of clinical symptoms. REM sleep remained normal in the first half of the episode but decreased in the second half: the differences between first and second half of episodes were significant for SWS (p = 0.014) and REM sleep (p = 0.027). The overall mean sleep latency at MSLT was 9.51 ± 4.82 minutes and 7 of 17 patients had two or more sleep onset REM periods during the symptomatic period. Conclusion: Important changes in sleep occur over time during the symptomatic period, with clear impairment of slow wave sleep at symptom onset. But Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is of little help in defining sleep problems and findings from the MSLT do not correlate with symptom onset.\n",

      "Objective: A variety of surgical interventions have been recommended for patients with Chiari malformations (CMs). In this study, we have evaluated the intraoperative findings and clinical outcome in different-aged patients with CMs undergoing posterior fossa decompression. Methods: Sixteen pediatric and 112 adult cases with CMs underwent suboccipital craniectomy and wide duraplasty as well as autogenous bone grafting in selected cases. The clinical outcome was assessed by evaluation of postoperative signs and symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging of the craniocervical junction. Results: The most striking intraoperative finding was the presence of a very thin membrane over the opening of the central canal; the occurrence of this membrane in pediatric patients was significantly higher than that in adults (94 and 43%, respectively; p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact probability test). During the immediate postoperative period, 81% of pediatric CMs and 90% of adult CMs showed improved symptomatology and magnetic resonance imaging revealed favorable findings comprising syrinx collapse or reduction of the syrinx diameter in 14 (88%) pediatric and 92 (82%) adult CMs. During discharge from hospital, 103 (90%) patients with CMs type I and 11 (85%) with CMs type II achieved good results. However, there was a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of poor results between patients treated with bony fusion and those without fusion (24 vs. 6%;p < 0.05, Fisher’s exact probability test). The incidence of vertebral instability was markedly augmented in pediatric CMs in comparison to adult CMs (19 vs. 2%; p < 0.01, Fisher’s exact probability test). Conclusions: Suboccipital decompression and duraplasty with autogenous bone grafts in selected cases are effective treatments for most patients with CMs. A higher incidence of a special membrane over the obex and atlantoaxial instability were closely associated with childhood CMs.\n",

      "When we bring to mind something we have seen before, our eyes spontaneously unfold in a sequential pattern strikingly similar to that made during the original encounter, even in the absence of supporting visual input. Oculomotor movements of the eye may then serve the opposite purpose of acquiring new visual information; they may serve as self-generated cues, pointing to stored memories. Over 50 years ago Donald Hebb, the forefather of cognitive neuroscience, posited that such a sequential replay of eye movements supports our ability to mentally recreate visuospatial relations during episodic remembering. However, direct evidence for this influential claim is lacking. Here we isolate the sequential properties of spontaneous eye movements during encoding and retrieval in a pure recall memory task and capture their encoding-retrieval overlap. Critically, we show that the fidelity with which a series of consecutive eye movements from initial encoding is sequentially retained during subsequent retrieval predicts the quality of the recalled memory. Our findings provide direct evidence that such scanpaths are replayed to assemble and reconstruct spatio-temporal relations as we remember and further suggest that distinct scanpath properties differentially contribute depending on the nature of the goal-relevant memory.\n",

For white patients the metastatic rates varied from 38 to 68 per cent as hospital affiliation varied, and for blacks they ranged from 48 to 76 per cent. Tests for normality showed that the distribution of rates for white patients in private facilities was not merely due to random variation. The metastatic rates for both racial groups tended to be inversely related to the proportion of whites among the patient populations and positively related to total patient load. Hospitals affiliated with medical schools had relatively high rates for white private patients. Several explanations of the data are suggested. They consider the possible effects of patient and physician health care practices and host vulnerability to the spread of breast cancer.\n",

      "Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) may potentially influence intracellular [Ca2+]i concentration by several mechanisms. We have investigated the effects of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] on Ca2+ signaling in rat airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells using fura-2 and imaging methodology. Wortmannin (1 μM) and LY-294002 (1 and 10 μM) had opposite effects: wortmannin caused a small increase, whereas LY-294002 caused a significant decrease of peak Ca2+ responses to serotonin (5-HT). LY-294002 (10 μM) diminished 5-HT-induced ASM cell contraction, measured as a change in cell surface area, and inositol phosphate formation, measured by anion exchange chromatography. Thin layer chromatography revealed that the levels of phospholipase C (PLC) substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were not affected. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting have shown that both wortmannin and LY-294002 inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced PI3K activation. However, PI3K activation could not be detected after 5-HT stimulation. The specific casein kinase-2 (CK2) inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole (10-40 μM) reduced 5-HT-triggered responses to a similar extent as LY-294002. We conclude that LY-294002 modulates Ca2+ signaling in rat ASM independently of its action on PI3K by acting on, or upstream of, PLC, possibly by inhibiting CK2.\n",

      "Cigarette smoke (CS) has a major impact on lung biology and may result in the development of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer. To understand the underlying mechanisms of disease development, it would be important to examine the impact of CS exposure directly on lung tissues. However, this approach is difficult to implement in epidemiological studies because lung tissue sampling is complex and invasive. Alternatively, tissue culture models can facilitate the assessment of exposure impacts on the lung tissue. Submerged 2D cell cultures, such as normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell cultures, have traditionally been used for this purpose. However, they cannot be exposed directly to smoke in a similar manner to the in vivo exposure situation. Recently developed 3D tissue culture models better reflect the in vivo situation because they can be cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). Their basal sides are immersed in the culture medium; whereas, their apical sides are exposed to air. Moreover, organotypic tissue cultures that contain different type of cells, better represent the physiology of the tissue in vivo. In this work, the utilization of an in vitro exposure system to expose human organotypic bronchial and nasal tissue models to mainstream CS is demonstrated. Ciliary beating frequency and the activity of cytochrome P450s (CYP) 1A1/1B1 were measured to assess functional impacts of CS on the tissues. Furthermore, to examine CS-induced alterations at the molecular level, gene expression profiles were generated from the tissues following exposure. A slight increase in CYP1A1/1B1 activity was observed in CS-exposed tissues compared with air-exposed tissues. A network-and transcriptomics-based systems biology approach was sufficiently robust to demonstrate CS-induced alterations of xenobiotic metabolism that were similar to those observed in the bronchial and nasal epithelial cells obtained from smokers.\n",

      "Abstract Although Mg2+ is an important cofactor for the specific degradation of RNA by ribozymes, it is not considered as a typical chemical nuclease. In this study we show that in combination with common buffers such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and sodium borate. Mg2+ is a powerful catalyst for the degradation of RNA. pH and temperature are found to be the principal factors for the efficient degradation of RNA. Whereas in Tris-HCl/Mg2+ the efficient cleavage starts at pH values higher than 7.5 and temperatures higher than 37 °C, in sodium borate RNA degradation begins at pH 7.0 and at 37 °C. RNA hydrolysis promoted under the combined catalytic activity of buffer/Mg2+ results in partially degraded RNA and negligible amounts of acid-soluble material. Reaction is insensitive to the concentration of monovalent cations but is completely prevented by chelating agents (EDTA and citrate) at concentrations exceeding that of Mg2+. Borate-magnesium reaction is inhibited also by some polyvalent alcohols (glycerol) and sugars.\n",

      "Surgical intervention in elderly patients carries a high risk. A frequent problem with surgery in these patients is the occurrence of a temporary confusional state, which increases both the risk of postoperative complications and the need for intensive care. We hypothesised that, in part, temporary confusional state results from cerebral hypoxia occurring in response to blood pressure fluctuations during surgery. To assess whether disruption of autoregulation of cerebral blood vessels plays a role in temporary confusional state, we studied 31 patients over 55 years of age, using the Doppler–carbon dioxide test. We determined whether vasomotor reactivity could be used diagnostically to identify those patients most likely to experience temporary confusional state. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was detected using Doppler ultrasound, and hypercapnia was induced by breathing carbon dioxide until an end‐tidal concentration of 8.0% by volume was reached. Vasomotor reactivity was calculated on the basis of the changes in blood flow velocity in response to the increase in carbon dioxide. Temporary confusional state was assessed using the Syndrome Short Test (Syndrom‐Kurztest). We found that resting blood flow velocity was inversely related to age (p < 0.05). In addition, there was a significant inverse correlation between vasomotor reactivity and temporary confusional state (p < 0.05). These data indicate that vasomotor reactivity, as measured by the Doppler‐carbon dioxide test, is a reliable tool to identify patients at risk for postoperative psychological disturbances.\n",

      "The purines ATP and adenosine can act as a coordinated team of transmitters. As extracellular adenosine is frequently derived from the enzymatic dephosphorylation of released ATP, the distinct actions of the two purines can be synchronized. In retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), stimulation of the P2X7 receptor for ATP leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ and death. Here we define the contrasting effects of adenosine and identify protective actions mediated by the A3 receptor. Adenosine attenuated the rise in Ca2+ produced by the P2X7 agonist 3′‐O‐(4‐benzoylbenzoyl)ATP (BzATP). Adenosine was also neuroprotective, increasing the survival of ganglion cells exposed to BzATP. The A3 adenosine receptor agonist 2‐chloro‐N6‐(3‐iodobenzyl)‐adenosine‐5′‐N‐methyluronimide (Cl‐IB‐MECA) mimicked the inhibition of the Ca2+ rise, whereas the A3 antagonist 3‐Ethyl‐5‐benzyl‐2‐methyl‐4‐phenylethynyl‐6‐phenyl‐1,4‐(±)‐dihydropyridine‐3,5‐dicarboxylate (MRS‐1191) reduced the protective effects of adenosine. Both Cl‐IB‐MECA and a second A3 receptor agonist IB‐MECA reduced the cell loss triggered by BzATP. The actions of BzATP were mimicked by ATPγS, but not by ATP. In summary, adenosine can stop the rise in Ca2+ and cell death resulting from stimulation of the P2X7 receptor on RGCs, with the A3 adenosine receptor contributing to this protection. Hydrolysis of ATP into adenosine and perhaps inosine shifts the balance of purinergic action from that of death to the preservation of life.\n",

      "Antarctica has one of the most extreme environments on Earth, with low temperatures and low nutrient levels. Antarctica’s organisms live primarily in the coastal, ice-free areas which cover approximately 0.18% of the continent’s surface. Members of Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae are important primary producers in Antarctica since they can synthesize organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water using solar energy. However, community structures of photosynthetic algae in Antarctica have not yet been fully explored at molecular level. In this study, we collected diverse algal samples in lacustrine and hydro-terrestrial environments of Langhovde and Skarvsnes, which are two ice-free regions in East Antarctica. We performed deep amplicon sequencing of both 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) and 18S rRNA genes, and we explored the distribution of sequence variants (SVs) of these genes at single nucleotide difference resolution. SVs of filamentous Cyanobacteria genera, including Leptolyngbya, Pseudanabaena, Phormidium, Nodosilinea, Geitlerinama, and Tychonema, were identified in most of the samples, whereas Phormidesmis SVs were distributed in fewer samples. We also detected unicellular, multicellular or heterocyst forming Cyanobacteria strains, but in relatively small abundance. For SVs of eukaryotic algae, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Ochrophyta were widely distributed among the collected samples. In addition, there was a red colored bloom of eukaryotic alga, Geminigera cryophile (Cryptophyta), in the Langhovde coastal area. Eukaryotic SVs of Acutuncus antarcticus and/or Diphascon pingue of Tardigrada were dominant among most of the samples. Our data revealed the detailed structures of the algal communities in Langhovde and Skarvsnes. This will contribute to our understanding of Antarctic ecosystems and support further research into this subject.\n",

      "Gut microbiota compositional alteration may have an association with immune dysfunction in patients with Behcet’s disease (BD). We conducted a fecal metagenomic analysis of BD patients. We analyzed fecal microbiota obtained from 12 patients with BD and 12 normal individuals by sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene. We compared the relative abundance of bacterial taxa. Direct comparison of the relative abundance of bacterial taxa demonstrated that the genera Bifidobacterium and Eggerthella increased significantly and the genera Megamonas and Prevotella decreased significantly in BD patients compared with normal individuals. A linear discriminant analysis of bacterial taxa showed that the phylum Actinobacteria, including Bifidobacterium, and the family Lactobacillaceae exhibited larger positive effect sizes than other bacteria in patients with BD. The phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia had large effect sizes in normal individuals. There was no significant difference in annotated species numbers (as numbers of operational taxonomic unit; OTU) and bacterial diversity of each sample (alpha diversity) between BD patients and normal individuals. We next assigned each sample to a position using three axes by principal coordinates analysis of the OTU table. The two groups had a significant distance as beta diversity in the 3-axis space. Fecal sIgA concentrations increased significantly in BD patients but did not correlate with any bacterial taxonomic abundance. These data suggest that the compositional changes of gut microbes may be one type of dysbiosis (unfavorable microbiota alteration) in patients with BD. The dysbiosis may have an association with the pathophysiology of BD.\n",

      "Calcium triggers dopamine release from presynaptic terminals of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the striatum. However, calcium transients within mDA axons and axon terminals are difficult to study and little is known about how they are regulated. Here we use a newly-developed method to measure presynaptic calcium transients (PreCaTs) in axons and terminals of mDA neurons with a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP3 expressed in transgenic mice. Using a photomultiplier tube-based system, we measured electrical stimulation-induced PreCaTs of mDA neurons in dorsolateral striatum slices from these mice. Single-pulse stimulation produced a transient increase in fluorescence that was completely blocked by a combination of N- and P/Q-type calcium channel blockers. DA and cholinergic, but not serotoninergic, signaling pathways modulated the PreCaTs in mDA fibers. These findings reveal heretofore unexplored dynamic modulation of presynaptic calcium in nigrostriatal terminals.\n",

      "Introduction There is some evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture, but it remains unclear whether trigger point acupuncture is effective. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of trigger point acupuncture on pain and quality of life in chronic low back pain patients compared with sham acupuncture. Methods Twenty-six consecutive out-patients (17 women, 9 men; age range: 65–91 years) from the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Meiji University of Oriental Medicine, with non-radiating low back pain for at least six months and normal neurological examination, were randomised to two groups. Each group received one phase of trigger point acupuncture and one of sham acupuncture with a three week washout period between them, over 12 weeks. Group A (n=13) received trigger point acupuncture in the first phase and sham acupuncture in the second. Group B (n=13) received the same interventions in the reverse order. Outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale, VAS) and Roland Morris Questionnaire. Results Nineteen patients were included in the analysis. At the end of the first treatment phase, group A receiving trigger point acupuncture scored significantly lower VAS (P<0.001) and Roland Morris Questionnaire scores (P<0.01) than the sham control group. There were significant within-group reductions in pain in both groups during the trigger point acupuncture phase but not in the sham treatment phase. However, the beneficial effects were not sustained. Conclusion These results suggest that trigger point acupuncture may have greater short term effects on low back pain in elderly patients than sham acupuncture.\n",

      "Abstract: An association between alcohol consumption and prostate cancer risk remains uncertain. Although some studies have found that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk, a recent study reported that red wine consumption is associated with reduced risk. We examined the association between alcohol use and prostate cancer among 34,565 men, 50–76 yr old, in the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort in Washington State. Alcohol consumption was ascertained by baseline questionnaire between October 2000 and December 2002. Incident prostate cancers (n = 816) as of December 31, 2004, were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry. Men who consumed more than one drink per month had a small increased risk of prostate cancer (hazard ratio, HR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.02–1.40) compared with men who drank no alcohol or less than one drink per month. White wine consumption was associated with increased risk (HR for any vs. no white wine consumption = 1.27; CI = 1.08–1.49). Red wine, liquor, and beer were not associated with prostate cancer nor was total alcohol consumed at ages 18, 30, and 45. Associations of alcohol use with prostate cancer are modest and complex. More detailed assessment of specific alcoholic beverages is warranted in future studies.\n",

      "Warburg effect describes the abnormal energy metabolism in cancer cells and pyruvate kinase type M2 is involved in the regulation of this effect. In the current study, the role of pyruvate kinase type M2 in the initiation of Warburg effect in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells was explored. The expression status of pyruvate kinase type M2 was detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma samples and analyzed by different clinicopathological characteristics. Then the level of pyruvate kinase type M2 was suppressed in 2 nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. The effects of pyruvate kinase type M2 inhibition on cell viability, apoptosis, invasion, glucose uptake, ATP generation, and glycolysis metabolism were determined. The data showed that the high expression of pyruvate kinase type M2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues was associated with the larger tumor size and advanced metastasis in the patients. The inhibition of pyruvate kinase type M2 resulted in the repressed proliferation and invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, along with the increased apoptotic rate. The lack of pyruvate kinase type M2 function inhibited glucose uptake, while increased ATP generation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Moreover, the production of glycolysis metabolites, including pyruvic acid, lactate, citrate, and malate, was also suppressed by pyruvate kinase type M2 inhibition. At molecular level, the expressions of glucose transporter and hexokinase 2 were downregulated by pyruvate kinase type M2 inhibition, confirming the changes in glucose metabolism. Collectively, the current study demonstrated that the function of pyruvate kinase type M2 was important to maintain the proliferation and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and the inhibition of the factor would antagonize nasopharyngeal carcinoma by blocking Warburg effect.\n",

      "In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the cell wall integrity (CWI) signalling pathway governs cell wall changes in response to external cues and normal CWI signalling is critical for appressorium function and pathogenicity. We previously characterized the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase MoMkk1 as an integral component of the CWI pathway. Using the affinity purification approach, we have identified MoMkk1-interacting MoPpe1 as a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae serine/threonine protein phosphatase Sit4/Ppe1. We found that MoPpe1 is required for vegetative growth, conidiation and full virulence. In addition, we found that MoPpe1 interacts with MoSap1, a protein with functions similar to MoPpe1. Intriguingly, we found that MoPpe1-MoSap1 interaction is related to CWI and target of rapamycin (TOR) pathways. We presented evidence suggesting that MoPpe1 and MoSap1 function as an adaptor complex linking CWI and TOR signalling and that the activation of the TOR pathway leads to suppression of CWI signalling, resulting in defects in appressorium function and pathogenicity. Taken together, our studies not only reveal important functions of MoMkk1-MoPpe1-MoSap1 interactions in growth and pathogenicity of the blast fungus, but also highlight the complexity of regulatory networks involving conserved yet novel regulatory mechanisms of CWI and TOR signalling.\n",

      "Silicosis is a form of occupational lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust. While the pathogenesis of silicosis is not clearly understood, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is thought to play a major role in lung fibrosis. To explore the role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in silicosis, we blocked Wnt/β-catenin pathway both in silica-treated MLE-12 cells (a mouse pulmonary epithelial cell line) and in a mouse silicosis model by using a lentiviral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA silencing β-catenin (Lv-shβ-catenin). In vitro, Lv-shβ-catenin significantly decreased the expression of β-catenin, MMP2 and MMP9, and secretion of TGF-β1. In vivo, intratracheal treatment with Lv-shβ-catenin significantly reduced expression of β-catenin in the lung and levels of TGF-β1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and notably attenuated pulmonary fibrosis as evidenced by hydroxyproline content and collagen I\\III synthesis in silica-administered mice. These results indicate that blockade of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can prevent the development of silica-induced lung fibrosis. Thus Wnt/β-catenin pathway may be a target in prevention and treatment of silicosis.\n",

      "Ovarian development plays an important role in the life history of insects and is crucial for control of the insect population. The metamorphosis of an insect is precisely regulated by the interaction of the juvenile hormone and ecdysone. To understand the role of NlBr and NlKr-h1 in ovary development, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to down-regulate the expression of Broad-Complex (Br) and Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1), two important down-stream transcription factors of juvenile hormone and ecdysone signaling. We further investigated their effects on metamorphosis and ovary development. The results showed that both NlBr and NlKr-h1 are induced by ecdysone. The down-regulation of NlBr and NlKr-h1 alone or together by RNAi is more effective than the topical application of ecdysone on the number of ovarioles, suggesting the necessity of NlBr and NlKr-h1 in determining the number of ovarioles. The ovarian grade was significantly increased/decreased by the topical application of ecdysone and down-regulation of NlBr and NlKr-h1. The pre-oviposition period was also increased. When NlBr and NlKr-h1 were down-regulated together, the ovary grade was not significantly different compared to the control (dsGFP), indicating that the development of the ovary is under the control of both NlBr and NlKr-h1. The interaction between the NlBr and NlKr-h1 on the number of ovarioles and the development of the ovary indicates cross-talk between both juvenile hormone and ecdysone signaling at the transcription level in the brown planthopper. Both genes are nuclear transcription factors and may regulate signaling via down-stream genes. These results would help to both enhance the current understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the interaction between juvenile hormone and ecdysone signaling pathways during ovarian development and to design chemicals to control pests.\n",

Recent advances in regenerative medicine by mesenchymal cells, including adipose stromal cells (ASC) have paved the way to improved periodontal regeneration (PD) but little is known about the biological processes involved. Here, we aimed to use syngeneic ASCs for periodontal regeneration in a new, relevant, bacteria‐induced periodontitis model in mice. Periodontal defects were induced in female C57BL6/J mice by oral gavage with periodontal pathogens. We grafted 2 × 105 syngeneic mouse ASCs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (GFP+/ASC) within a collagen vehicle in the lingual part of the first lower molar periodontium (experimental) while carrier alone was implanted in the contralateral side (control). Animals were sacrificed 0, 1, 6, and 12 weeks after treatment by GFP+/ASC or vehicle graft, and microscopic examination, immunofluorescence, and innovative bio‐informatics histomorphometry methods were used to reveal deep periodontium changes. From 1 to 6 weeks after surgery, GFP+ cells were identified in the periodontal ligament (PDL), in experimental sites only. After 12 weeks, cementum regeneration, the organization of PDL fibers, the number of PD vessels, and bone morphogenetic protein‐2 and osteopontin expression were greater in experimental sites than in controls. Specific stromal cell subsets were recruited in the newly formed tissue in ASC‐implanted periodontium only. These data suggest that ASC grafting in diseased deep periodontium, relevant to human pathology, induces a significant improvement of the PDL microenvironment, leading to a recovery of tooth‐supporting tissue homeostasis.

Despite that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) had tremendous improved the survival of multiple solid tumors, only a limited proportion of patients are responsive to ICIs. Therefore, effective variables are urgently needed to predict the probability of response to ICIs. Systematic searches were conducted from inception up to May, 2020. Prospective or retrospective studies of ICIs that investigated the association between body mass index (BMI) and survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free survival (PFS), were selected. The association between each BMI category and survival outcomes was calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models and quantified as hazard ratio (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval. Seven clinical studies involving data from 3768 individual patients were included. The median OS was 15.5 months (95% confidence interval: 14.7–16.2 mo) and the median PFS was 5.7 months (5.2–6.3 mo). The median OS was significantly longer in overweight/obese patients than in nonoverweight patients (20.7 vs. 11.3 mo; P<0.001). The difference in OS between overweight and obese patients was not statistically significant (HR: 1.14, P=0.098). Similar results were observed for PFS outcomes. Subgroup analysis demonstrated improved OS in overweight/obese patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (HR: 0.81, P=0.002), melanoma (HR: 0.66, P<0.001), renal cell carcinoma (HR: 0.53, P<0.001), and multiple cancer type (HR: 0.34, P<0.001), with parallel results noted regarding PFS outcomes. Results of the present study suggested that BMI may be a satisfactory prognostic factor for patients treated with ICIs.\n",

This study is aimed to determine reference intervals, in males and females, suitable for thyroid disease exploration during adult life using routinely collected serum thyrotropin (TSH) data in a tertiary center from 2007 to 2018. Over 11 years, 295,775 TSH levels were measured in a single lab. Among the 156,025 TSH results available for analysis, 90,538 values were from female subjects, 82,019 were from patients aged >60 years and 26,825 were from patients aged >80 years. By using an indirect approach, we determined reference values of TSH adapted to age and sex, and we then evaluated the proportion of patients who would have been reclassified with these reference values. The median TSH ranged from 1.2–1.4 mUI/L during the study period. The upper limit of reference range of TSH increased with age; in females the median to 97.5th percentile values increased continuously from the age of 30 years to the oldest age group. Using new calculated reference values in patients with TSH above the conventional upper-limit reference value (4 mUI/L), the proportion of results reclassified as within the reference interval among patients aged >60 years ranged, according to age group, from 50.5% to 65.1% of females and from 33.0% to 37.7% of males. The use of TSH age-specific and sex-specific upper-limit reference values led to the reclassification of a great number of samples, notably among women. This suggests that age-specific TSH upper-limit reference intervals in daily practice should be used in order to avoid misclassification.\n",

For comparison, family-based data collected previously from another North Indian Punjabi Sikh (SI) EEG was used. In addition, we examined various T2D-related cardiometabolic traits and determined their heritabilities. These studies were conducted as part of the Indian Diabetes Genetic Studies in collaboration with US (INDIGENIUS) Consortium. The pedigree, demographic, phenotypic, covariate data and samples were collected from the CH, AG, and RE EEGs. The status of T2D was defined by ADA guidelines (fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and/or use of diabetes medication/history). The prevalence of T2D in CH (N = 517, families = 21, mean age = 47y, mean BMI = 27), AG (N = 530, Families = 25, mean age = 43y, mean BMI = 27), and RE (N = 500, Families = 22, mean age = 46y, mean BMI = 27) was found to be 33%, 37%, and 36%, respectively, Also, the study participants from these EEGs were found to be at increased cardiometabolic risk (e.g., obesity and prediabetes). Similar characteristics for the SI EEG (N = 1,260, Families = 324, Age = 51y, BMI = 27, T2D = 75%) were obtained previously. We used the variance components approach to carry out genetic analyses after adjusting for covariate effects. The heritability (h2) estimates of T2D in the CH, RE, SI, and AG were found to be 30%, 46%, 54%, and 82% respectively, and statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05). Other T2D related traits (e.g., BMI, lipids, blood pressure) in AG, CH, and RE EEGs exhibited strong additive genetic influences (h2 range: 17% [triglycerides/AG and hs-CRP/RE] - 86% [glucose/non-T2D/AG]). Our findings highlight the high burden of T2D in Indian EEGs with significant and differential additive genetic influences on T2D and related traits.\n",

      "The microbiomes in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of individuals receiving antibiotics and those in obese subjects undergo compositional shifts, the metabolic effects and linkages of which are not clearly understood. Herein, we set to gain insight into these effects, particularly with regard to carbohydrate metabolism, and to contribute to unravel the underlying mechanisms and consequences for health conditions. We measured the activity level of GIT carbohydrate-active enzymes toward 23 distinct sugars in adults patients (n = 2) receiving 14-d β-lactam therapy and in obese (n = 7) and lean (n = 5) adolescents. We observed that both 14 d antibiotic-treated and obese subjects showed higher and less balanced sugar anabolic capacities, with 40% carbohydrates being preferentially processed as compared with non-treated and lean patients. Metaproteome-wide metabolic reconstructions confirmed that the impaired utilization of sugars propagated throughout the pentose phosphate metabolism, which had adverse consequences for the metabolic status of the GIT microbiota. The results point to an age-independent positive association between GIT glycosidase activity and the body mass index, fasting blood glucose and insulin resistance (r2 ≥ 0.95). Moreover, antibiotics altered the active fraction of enzymes controlling the thickness, composition and consistency of the mucin glycans. Our data and analyses provide biochemical insights into the effects of antibiotic usage on the dynamics of the GIT microbiota and pin-point presumptive links to obesity. The knowledge and the hypotheses generated herein lay a foundation for subsequent, systematic research that will be paramount for the design of “smart” dietary and therapeutic interventions to modulate host-microbe metabolic co-regulation in intestinal homeostasis.\n",

      "Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is affecting more people globally. Indeed, NAFLD is a spectrum of metabolic dysfunctions that can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (NAFLD-HCC). This development can occur in a non-cirrhotic liver and thus, often lack clinical surveillance. The aim of this study was to develop non-invasive surveillance method for NAFLD-HCC. Methods Using comprehensive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry, we investigated 1,295 metabolites in serum from 249 patients. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated for all detected metabolites and used to establish their diagnostic potential. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish the diagnostic score. Findings We show that NAFLD-HCC is characterised by a complete rearrangement of the serum lipidome, which distinguishes NAFLD-HCC from non-cancerous individuals and other HCC patients. We used machine learning to build a diagnostic model for NAFLD-HCC. We quantified predictive metabolites and developed the NAFLD-HCC Diagnostic Score (NHDS), presenting superior diagnostic potential compared to alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Patients’ metabolic landscapes show a progressive depletion in unsaturated fatty acids and acylcarnitines during transformation. Upregulation of fatty acid transporters in NAFLD-HCC tumours contribute to fatty acid depletion in the serum. Interpretation NAFLD-HCC patients can be efficiently distinguished by serum metabolic alterations from the healthy population and from HCC patients related to other aetiologies (alcohol and viral hepatitis). Our model can be used for non-invasive surveillance of individuals with metabolic syndrome(s), allowing for early detection of NAFLD-HCC. Therefore, serum metabolomics may provide valuable insight to monitor patients at risk, including morbidly obese, diabetics, and NAFLD patients. Funding The funding sources for this study had no role in study design, data collection, data analyses, interpretation or writing of the report as it is presented herein.\n",

      "Background and purpose Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a complication that may cause neurological deterioration in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Various radiological subtypes of HT can be distinguished. Their influence on functional outcome is currently unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the associations between HT subtypes and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with proven large vessel occlusion included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic stroke in The Netherlands). Methods All patients with follow-up imaging were included. HT was classified on follow-up CT scans according to the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II classification. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 90 days after stroke onset. Ordinal logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders was used to determine the association of HT subtypes with functional outcome. Results Of 478 patients, 222 had HT. Of these, 76 (16%) patients were classified as hemorrhagic infarction type 1, 71 (15%) as hemorrhagic infarction type 2, 36 (8%) as parenchymal hematoma type 1, and 39 (8%) as parenchymal hematoma type 2. Hemorrhagic infarction type 2 (adjusted common OR (acOR) 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.89) and parenchymal hematoma type 2 (acOR 0.37, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78) were significantly associated with a worse functional outcome. Hemorrhagic infarction type 1 and parenchymal hematoma type 1 were not significantly associated, although their point estimates pointed in the direction of worse outcome. Conclusion This study suggests that parenchymal hematoma type 2 is relevant for functional outcome after an acute ischemic stroke, and smaller HTs might also influence long term functional outcome.

      "Background: mESCs are deficient in type I IFN expression. Results: mESCs can respond to type I IFNs and express interferon-stimulated genes. Conclusion: mESCs are unable to express type I IFNs but can respond to type I IFNs. Significance: The findings are important for understanding the antiviral mechanisms and innate immunity in ESCs. We have recently reported that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are deficient in expressing type I interferons (IFNs) in response to viral infection and synthetic viral RNA analogs (Wang, R., Wang, J., Paul, A. M., Acharya, D., Bai, F., Huang, F., and Guo, Y. L. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 15926–15936). Here, we report that mESCs are able to respond to type I IFNs, express IFN-stimulated genes, and mediate the antiviral effect of type I IFNs against La Crosse virus and chikungunya virus. The major signaling components in the IFN pathway are expressed in mESCs. Therefore, the basic molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of type I IFNs are functional in mESCs; however, these mechanisms may not yet be fully developed as mESCs express lower levels of IFN-stimulated genes and display weaker antiviral activity in response to type I IFNs when compared with fibroblasts. Further analysis demonstrated that type I IFNs do not affect the stem cell state of mESCs. We conclude that mESCs are deficient in type I IFN expression, but they can respond to and mediate the cellular effects of type I IFNs. These findings represent unique and uncharacterized properties of mESCs and are important for understanding innate immunity development and ESC physiology.\n",

      "There is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes in people of South Asian origin living in affluent western countries. We do not know whether or how risk factors for these diseases change in subsequent generations born in the west. Findings that birth‐weight is inversely associated with abdominal obesity and risk of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes in later life suggest that those born in the west may have lower levels of risk than migrants. We assessed 30 migrants from Pakistan to the UK, 30 British‐born British Pakistani women, and 25 British‐born women of European origin. British‐born British Pakistani women were taller (P = 0.05), had a lower waist to hip ratio (P = 0.04), lower mean fasting glucose levels (P = 0.03), lower mean triglyceride levels (P = 0.03), and higher mean HDL levels (P < 0.001) than migrant British Pakistani women. Levels of fasting insulin, HOMA‐IR, and blood pressure were not significantly different in the two British Pakistani groups. Thus, we found healthier levels of several cardiovascular and Type 2 diabetes risk factors in British‐born British Pakistani women than in migrant British Pakistani women. These findings might be related to the effects of early environment or to other factors, such as differences in health behaviors. British‐born British Pakistani women also differed from British‐born European women, having a more adverse body composition, but healthier levels of HDL cholesterol and blood pressure. Am. J. Hum.

      "A 13‐Week Toxicity Study of Bismuth in Rats by Intratracheal Intermittent Administration: Yuri Sano, et al. Department of Preventative Medicine and Public Health, School of Medicine, Keio University—Although bismuth is widely used as a lead substitute in the industrial field, the toxicity of bismuth by inhalation is little known. We performed a 13‐wk intratracheal intermittent bismuth dose toxicity study. Bismuth was administered at dose levels of 0, 0.8, 4, 20 mg/kg to male Crj:CD(SD)IGS rats (SPF) by intratracheal intermittent administration once a week for thirteen weeks to investigate its potential toxic effects; especially for specific adverse effects and changes related to pre‐neoplastic lesions. Our results showed foreign body inflammation in the lungs, which was caused by intratracheal administration of bismuth, and physical changes related to pulmonary lesions; however, there were no serious changes in other organs. We concluded that dose‐dependent, but not specific adverse effects, were attributable to bismuth inhalation in the rat.\n",

      "More than 90% of dorsal horn neurons from embryonic day 15–16 rats responded to the inhibitory amino acids GABA and glycine by a transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) when maintained in culture for <1 week. This [Ca2+]i response has previously been shown to be due to depolarization and subsequent Ca2+ entry through voltage‐gated Ca2+ channels following activation of bicuculline‐sensitive GABAA receptors and strychnine‐sensitive glycine receptors. Both the number of cells responding to GABA and glycine and the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i response diminished over time in culture. By 30 days in culture, none of the cells responded to GABA, muscimol or glycine by elevation of [Ca2+]i. The loss of the [Ca2+]i response was not due to a change in the abundance or the properties of voltage‐gated Ca2+ channels, since over the same period of time dorsal horn neurons showed a large increase in the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient in response to 30 mM K+. Nor was the loss of the [Ca2+]i response due to a loss of GABA and glycine receptors. Instead, the decrease in the [Ca2+]i response over time paralleled a similar change in the electrophysiological responses. More than 90% of the neurons tested were depolarized in response to inhibitory amino acids during the first week in culture. After 30 days, all neurons tested responded to GABA and glycine with a hyperpolarization. These observations add support to the suggestion that GABA and glycine may excite dorsal horn neurons earlyin development and play a role in postmitotic differentiation.\n",

      "Smallpox was one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity. Although smallpox was eradicated through a historically successful vaccination campaign, there is concern in the global community that either Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox, or another species of Orthopoxvirus could be used as agents of bioterrorism. Therefore, development of countermeasures to Orthopoxvirus infection is a crucial focus in biodefense research, and these efforts rely on the use of various animal models. Smallpox typically presented as a generalized pustular rash with 30 to 40% mortality, and although smallpox-like syndromes can be induced in cynomolgus macaques with VARV, research with this virus is highly restricted; therefore, animal models with other orthopoxviruses have been investigated. Monkeypox virus causes a generalized vesiculopustular rash in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and induces fatal systemic disease in several rodent species. Ectromelia virus has been extensively studied in mice as a model of orthopoxviral infection in its natural host. Intranasal inoculation of mice with some strains of vaccinia virus produces fatal bronchopneumonia, as does aerosol or intranasal inoculation of mice with cowpox virus. Rabbitpox virus causes pneumonia and fatal systemic infections in rabbits and can be naturally transmitted between rabbits by an aerosol route similar to that of VARV in humans. No single animal model recapitulates all known aspects of human Orthopoxvirus infections, and each model has its advantages and disadvantages. This article provides a brief review of the Orthopoxvirus diseases of humans and the key pathologic features of animal models of Orthopoxvirus infections.\n",

      "Conceptualizations of the underlying neurobiology of major depression have changed their focus from dysfunctions of neurotransmission to dysfunctions of neurogenesis and neuroprotection. The “neurogenesis hypothesis of depression” posits that changes in the rate of neurogenesis are the underlying mechanism in the pathology and treatment of major depression. Stress, neuroinflammation, dysfunctional insulin regulation, oxidative stress, and alterations in neurotrophic factors possibly contribute to the development of depression. The influence of antidepressant therapies, namely pharmacotherapy and neuroprotectants, on cellular plasticity are summarized. A dysfunction of complex neuronal networks as a consequence of neural degeneration in neuropsychiatric diseases has led to the application of deep brain stimulation. We discuss the way depression seen in the light of the neurogenesis hypothesis can be used as a model disease for cerebral aging. A common pathological mechanism in depression and cerebral aging—a dysfunction of neuroprotection and neurogenesis—is discussed. This has implications for new treatment methods.\n",

      "Thinning or dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal may occur on the middle cranial fossa floor or adjacent to the superior petrosal sinus (SPS). However, no symptomatic cases of superior canal dehiscence by SPS have been previously described. A 45-year-old woman presented with left-side pulsating tinnitus, autophony and disequilibrium. Examination showed conductive hearing loss and decreased threshold of vestibular evoked myogenic potential in the left side. Sound and vibration stimuli and positive pressure insufflations into the left ear evoked mainly torsional nystagmus instead of vertical-torsional nystagmus. High-resolution temporal bone CT revealed a dehiscence of the superior canal close to the common crus, which was encased by SPS. Symptoms and signs resolved after plugging the dehiscence through a middle fossa approach. Deep groove of SPS may cause superior canal dehiscence close to the common crus, and costimulation of the superior and posterior canals may explain the mainly torsional nystagmus induced by sound and vibration stimuli.\n",

      "Prescription opioid use has risen steeply for over two decades, driven primarily by advocacy for better management of chronic non-cancer pain, but also by poor opioid stewardship in the management of acute pain. Inappropriate prescribing, among other things, contributed to the opioid ‘epidemic’ and striking increases in patient harm. It has also seen a greater proportion of opioid-tolerant patients presenting to acute care hospitals. Effective and safe management of acute pain in opioid-tolerant patients can be challenging, with higher risks of opioid-induced ventilatory impairment and persistent post-discharge opioid use compared with opioid-naive patients. There are also increased risks of some less well known adverse postoperative outcomes including infection, earlier revision rates after major joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion, longer hospital stays, higher re-admission rates and increased healthcare costs. Increasingly, opioid-free/opioid-sparing techniques have been advocated as ways to reduce patient harm. However, good evidence for these remains lacking and opioids will continue to play an important role in the management of acute pain in many patients. Better opioid stewardship with consideration of preoperative opioid weaning in some patients, assessment of patient function rather than relying on pain scores alone to assess adequacy of analgesia, prescription of immediate release opioids only and evidence-based use of analgesic adjuvants are important. Post-discharge opioid prescribing should be contingent on an assessment of patient risk, with short-term only use of opioids. In partnership with pharmacists, nursing staff, other medical specialists, general practitioners and patients, anaesthetists remain ideally positioned to be involved in opioid stewardship in the acute care setting.\n",

      "Phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) by Ca2+‐calmodulin–activated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is known to be essential for the inotropic function of the heart. In this study, we have examined the effects of MLCK‐phosphorylation of transgenic (Tg) mouse cardiac muscle preparations expressing the D166V (aspartic acid to valine)–RLC mutation, identified to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with malignant outcomes. Our previous work with Tg‐D166V mice demonstrated a large increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction, reduced maximal ATPase and force and a decreased level of endogenous RLC phosphorylation. Based on studies demonstrating the beneficial and/or protective effects of cardiac myosin phosphorylation for heart function, we hypothesized that an ex vivo phosphorylation of Tg‐D166V cardiac muscle may rescue the detrimental contractile phenotypes observed earlier at the level of single myosin molecules and in Tg‐D166V papillary muscle fibres. We showed that MLCK‐induced phosphorylation of Tg‐D166V cardiac myofibrils and muscle fibres was able to increase the reduced myofibrillar ATPase and reverse an abnormally increased Ca2+ sensitivity of force to the level observed for Tg‐wild‐type (WT) muscle. However, in contrast to Tg‐WT, which displayed a phosphorylation‐induced increase in steady‐state force, the maximal tension in Tg‐D166V papillary muscle fibres decreased upon phosphorylation. With the exception of force generation data, our results support the notion that RLC phosphorylation works as a rescue mechanism alleviating detrimental functional effects of a disease causing mutation. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this unexpected phosphorylation‐induced decrease in maximal tension in Tg‐D166V–skinned muscle fibres.\n",

      "The vomeronasal projection conveys information provided by pheromones and detected by neurones in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and thence to other regions of the brain such as the amygdala. The VNO-AOB projection is topographically organised such that axons from apical and basal parts of the VNO terminate in the anterior and posterior AOB respectively. We provide evidence that the Slit family of axon guidance molecules and their Robo receptors contribute to the topographic targeting of basal vomeronasal axons. Robo receptor expression is confined largely to basal VNO axons, while Slits are differentially expressed in the AOB with a higher concentration in the anterior part, which basal axons do not invade. Immunohistochemistry using a Robo-specific antibody reveals a zone-specific targeting of VNO axons in the AOB well before cell bodies of these neurones in the VNO acquire their final zonal position. In vitro assays show that Slit1-Slit3 chemorepel VNO axons, suggesting that basal axons are guided to the posterior AOB due to chemorepulsive activity of Slits in the anterior AOB. These data in combination with recently obtained other data suggest a model for the topographic targeting in the vomeronasal projection where ephrin-As and neuropilins guide apical VNO axons, while Robo/Slit interactions are important components in the targeting of basal VNO axons.\n",

      "The present study examined the structure and dynamics of the most active and thermostable carbonic anhydrase, SazCA, probed using molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular system was described by widely used biological force‐fields (AMBER, CHARMM22, CHARMM36, and OPLS‐AA) in conjunction with TIP3P water model. The comparison of molecular dynamics simulation results suggested AMBER to be a suitable choice to describe the structure and dynamics of SazCA. In addition to this, we also addressed the effect of temperature on the stability of SazCA. We performed molecular dynamics simulations at 313, 333, 353, 373, and 393 K to study the relationship between thermostability and flexibility in SazCA. The amino acid residues VAL98, ASN99, GLY100, LYS101, GLU145, and HIS207 were identified as the most flexible residues from root‐mean‐square fluctuations. The salt bridge analysis showed that ion‐pairs ASP113‐LYS81, ASP115‐LYS81, ASP115‐LYS114, GLU144‐LYS143, and GLU144‐LYS206, were responsible for the compromised thermal stability of SazCA.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To present a general overview of the etiology, definition, and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as outline possible treatment strategies. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted for relevant references generated from 1990 to 2000 concerning MCI, mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD), and therapeutic strategies. Several books were also used in the compilation of data for this review, as well as the authors' experience in designing and conducting MCI trials. DATA EXTRACTION: All of the references listed were assessed, and all relevant information was included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Forgetful individuals most likely to develop AD have a condition known as MCI previous to their development of dementia. This condition is hallmarked by memory impairment that is abnormal for the individual's age and educational level. While not all individuals with MCI develop AD, it is apparent that the condition can serve as a potential marker for early onset of AD. CONCLUSIONS: As many clinicians can attest, occasional forgetfulness is a common aspect of the aging process. Eventually, however, a large portion of forgetful individuals, especially those with MCI, will be diagnosed with AD or some other form of dementia. Indeed, many researchers have suggested that MCI should be regarded as incipient AD and that these individuals would benefit from drug therapy. Thus, MCI screening may be beneficial in terms of both early AD intervention and perhaps even AD prevention.\n",

      "Purpose: To compare the increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) during corneal flap preparation in porcine eyes when using a femtosecond laser or a mechanical microkeratome. Setting: The present study was conducted at a university hospital and a private clinic. Methods: The vitreous IOP was directly measured with a cannula through the optic nerve in 24 porcine globes (n = 12 for each device). In the first procedure (worst-case procedure), the eye interface was lowered against the globe until abortion of the docking maneuver when using the IntraLase femtosecond laser (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) or the suction ring was pressed very firmly against the globe when using the Amadeus microkeratome (Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG, Port, Switzerland). In the second procedure (regular procedure), a normal lamellar flap creation was performed using each of these devices. Results: During the worst-case procedure, a maximum IOP of 260 ± 53 mm Hg (mean ± SD) was reached with the IntraLase and 318 ± 59 mm Hg was reached with the Amadeus. During the regular procedure, the maximum IOP increased to 135 ± 16 mm Hg when using the IntraLase femtosecond laser and to 152 ± 24 mm Hg with the Amadeus microkeratome. Conclusions: In the worst-case procedure, the maximum IOP levels were lower in the IntraLase group. No significant difference in maximum IOP levels could be obtained during the regular procedure. The duration of the suction phase is longer when using the IntraLase femtosecond laser.\n",

      "Platelet function can be modified by cancer cells to support tumor growth, causing alterations in the delicate hemostatic equilibrium. Cancer-cell and platelet interactions are one of the main pillars of Trousseau’s syndrome: a paraneoplastic syndrome with recurring and migrating episodes of thrombophlebitis. Altogether, this leads to a four-fold risk of thrombotic events in cancer patients, which in turn, portend a poor prognosis. We previously demonstrated that anti-P2RY12 drugs inhibit cancer-associated-thrombosis and formation of tumor metastasis in pancreatic cancer models. Here, we aimed to (1) compare the effects of aspirin and clopidogrel on pancreatic cancer prevention, (2) characterize the effects of clopidogrel (platelet P2RY12 inhibitor) on cancer-associated thrombosis and cancer growth in vivo, (3) determine the effect of P2RY12 across different digestive-tract cancers in vitro, and (4) analyze the expression pattern of P2RY12 in two different cancer types affecting the digestive system. Clopidogrel treatment resulted in better survival rates with smaller primary tumors and less metastasis than aspirin treatment. Clopidogrel was also more effective than aspirin at dissolving spontaneous endogenous thrombi in our orthotopic advanced cancer mouse model. P2RY12 expression gives pancreatic adenocarcinomas proliferative advantages. In conclusion, we propose the hypothesis that clopidogrel should be further studied to target and prevent Trousseau’s syndrome; as well as diminish cancer growth and spread. However, more studies are required to determine the implicated pathways and effects of these drugs on cancer development.\n",

      "Engineered living materials have the potential for wide-ranging applications such as biosensing and treatment of diseases. Programmable cells provide the functional basis for living materials, however, their release into the environment raises numerous biosafety concerns. Current designs that limit the release of genetically engineered cells typically involve the fabrication of multi-layer hybrid materials with sub-micron porous matrices. Nevertheless the stringent physical barriers limit the diffusion of macromolecules and therefore the repertoire of molecules available for actuation in response to communication signals between cells and their environment. Here, we engineer a first-of-its-kind living material entitled ‘Platform for Adhesin-mediated Trapping of Cells in Hydrogels’ (PATCH). This technology is based on engineered E. coli that displays an adhesion protein derived from an Antarctic bacterium with high affinity for glucose. The adhesin stably anchors E. coli in dextran-based hydrogels with large pore diameters (10-100 μm) and reduces the leakage of bacteria into the environment by up to 100-fold. As an application of PATCH, we engineered E. coli to secrete lysostaphin via the Type 1 Secretion System and demonstrated that living materials containing this E. coli inhibit the growth of S. aureus, including the strain resistant to methicillin (MRSA). Our tunable platform allows stable integration of programmable cells in dextran-based hydrogels without compromising free diffusion of macromolecules and could have potential applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.\n",

Constitutive IKs recorded from guinea‐pig ventricular myocytes was suppressed by broad‐spectrum tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors tyrphostin A23 (IC50, 4.1 ± 0.6 μm), tyrphostin A25 (IC50, 12.1 ± 2.1 μm) and genistein (IC50, 64 ± 4 μm), but was relatively insensitive to the inactive analogues tyrphostin A1, tyrphostin A63, daidzein and genistin. IKs was unaffected by AG1478 (10 μm), an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor TK, and was strongly suppressed by the Src TK inhibitor PP2 (10 μm) but not by the inactive analogue PP3 (10 μm). The results of experiments with forskolin, H89 and bisindolylmaleimide I indicate that the suppression of IKs by TK inhibitors was not mediated via inhibition of (IKs‐stimulatory) protein kinases A and C. To evaluate whether the suppression was related to lowered tyrosine phosphorylation, myocytes were pretreated with TK inhibitors and then exposed to the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (1 mm). Orthovanadate almost completely reversed the suppression of IKs induced by broad‐spectrum TK inhibitors at concentrations around their IC50 values. We conclude that basal IKs is strongly dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of Ks channel (or channel‐regulatory) protein.\n",

      "The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii lives inside a vacuole in the host cytosol where it is protected from host cytoplasmic innate immune responses. However, IFNγ‐dependent cell‐autonomous immunity can destroy the vacuole and the parasite inside. Toxoplasma strain differences in susceptibility to human IFNγ exist, but the Toxoplasma effector(s) that determine these differences are unknown. We show that in human primary fibroblasts, the polymorphic Toxoplasma‐secreted effector GRA15 mediates the recruitment of ubiquitin ligases, including TRAF2 and TRAF6, to the vacuole membrane, which enhances recruitment of ubiquitin receptors (p62/NDP52) and ubiquitin‐like molecules (LC3B, GABARAP). This ultimately leads to lysosomal degradation of the vacuole. In murine fibroblasts, GRA15‐mediated TRAF6 recruitment mediates the recruitment of immunity‐related GTPases and destruction of the vacuole. Thus, we have identified how the Toxoplasma effector GRA15 affects cell‐autonomous immunity in human and murine cells.\n",

In the present study, we evaluated the potential antitumor effects of a novel anti‐angiogenesis agent, pazopanib, against synovial sarcoma cells. We found that pazopanib directly inhibited the growth of synovial sarcoma cells by inducing G1 arrest. Multiplex analyses revealed that the PI3K‐AKT pathway was highly suppressed in pazopanib‐sensitive synovial sarcoma cells. Furthermore, administration of pazopanib highly suppressed the tumor growth in a xenograft model. Taken together, these results suggest pazopanib as a possible agent against synovial sarcoma and may warrant further clinical studies. © 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "Objectives The aims of the study were to compare survival outcomes between patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and to determine candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods A total of 579 consecutive patients, including 375 PDAC and 204 IPMN patients, were reviewed. Stage-matched comparisons of survival data were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model and propensity analysis. To evaluate prognostic factors, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Results The overall survival for invasive IPMN was significantly longer than that for PDAC (hazard ratio, 2.34; P = 0.0001). When the analysis was limited to stage I patients, the 5-year overall survival rate of invasive IPMN patients was significantly better than that of PDAC patients (100% vs 74.1%, P = 0.0092); however, no difference was observed between stage II patients with invasive IPMN and PDAC (hazard ratio, 1.49; P = 0.09). The Cox proportional hazards model and propensity analysis demonstrated no difference in stage-matched survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that only T (≥3) was an independent prognostic factor for invasive IPMN. Conclusions Stage-matched analysis did not show a significant survival difference between invasive IPMN and PDAC patients, and T3 or higher was an independent prognostic factor for invasive IPMN.\n",

      "Objective To characterize the vaginal microbiota of women following preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and determine if microbiome composition predicts latency duration and perinatal outcomes. Design A prospective cohort study Setting Canada Population Women with PPROM between 24+0 and 33+6 weeks gestational age (GA). Methods Microbiome profiles, based on pyrosequencing of the cpn60 universal target, were generated from vaginal samples at time of presentation with PPROM, weekly thereafter, and at delivery. Main Outcome Measures Vaginal microbiome composition, latency duration, gestational age at delivery, perinatal outcomes. Results Microbiome profiles were generated from 70 samples from 36 women. Mean GA at PPROM was 28.8 wk (mean latency 2.7 wk). Microbiome profiles were highly diverse but sequences representing Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. were detected in all vaginal samples. Only 13/70 samples were dominated by Lactobacillus spp. Microbiome profiles at the time of membrane rupture did not cluster by gestational age at PPROM, latency duration, presence of chorioamnionitis or by infant outcomes. Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma were detected by PCR in 81% (29/36) of women, and these women had significantly lower GA at delivery and correspondingly lower birth weight infants than Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma negative women. Conclusion Women with PPROM had mixed, abnormal vaginal microbiota but the microbiome profile at PPROM did not correlate with latency duration. Prevotella spp. and Megasphaera type I were ubiquitous. The presence of Mollicutes in the vaginal microbiome was associated with lower GA at delivery. The microbiome was remarkably unstable during the latency period.\n",

      "The aim of this study was to compare the results of automatic assessment of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) by artificial intelligence (AI) in 150 patients from three subgroups: pneumonia in the course of COVID-19, bronchopneumonia and atypical pneumonia. The volume percentage of inflammation and the volume percentage of “ground glass” were significantly higher in the atypical (respectively, 11.04%, 8.61%) and the COVID-19 (12.41%, 10.41%) subgroups compared to the bronchopneumonia (5.12%, 3.42%) subgroup. The volume percentage of consolidation was significantly higher in the COVID-19 (2.95%) subgroup compared to the atypical (1.26%) subgroup. The percentage of “ground glass” in the volume of inflammation was significantly higher in the atypical (89.85%) subgroup compared to the COVID-19 (79.06%) subgroup, which in turn was significantly higher compared to the bronchopneumonia (68.26%) subgroup. HRCT chest images, analyzed automatically by artificial intelligence software, taking into account the structure including “ground glass” and consolidation, significantly differ in three subgroups: COVID-19 pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and atypical pneumonia. However, the partial overlap, particularly between COVID-19 pneumonia and atypical pneumonia, may limit the usefulness of automatic analysis in differentiating the etiology. In our future research, we plan to use artificial intelligence for objective assessment of the dynamics of pulmonary lesions during COVID-19 pneumonia.\n",

      "Background: Adenocarcinoma is the most frequent pathological type of stomach cancer. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a lymphoproliferative disease arising from lymphoid tissue which is characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells. Synchronous occurrence of these two malignancies has not been reported in the English literature so far. Case: Here we present a 52-year-old male complaining of epigastric pain and fever diagnosed as stomach adenocarcinoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Conclusion: It is thought that this case is the first of a synchronous stomach adenocarcinoma and Hodgkin’s lymphoma encountered in the English literature. It should be kept in mind that second malignancies can be seen in mass lesions in patients diagnosed with cancer.\n",

      "Abstract On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the ‘Belgian Association of Burn Injuries’ an inventory was made of all surgical techniques used in the five largest Belgian burn centres in order to draw up a consensus document. A questionnaire covering the whole treatment of severely burned patients was sent to the surgeons of each burn unit, ranging from emergency treatment, through diagnostic techniques, burn surgery and post-healing treatment (scars, contractures). During the past decade, several (often expensive) new techniques have been commercialised, resulting in a wide variety of treatment modalities in the different centres. For the majority of burns, however, a similar protocol is followed: the superficial burns are treated conservatively and the deep burns surgically. Nevertheless, burns of indeterminate depth are susceptible to variations in their treatment. There are also different therapeutic options for the deepest burns, from the use of donor skin to dermal substitutes as well as cultured keratinocytes. The writing of this consensus required intense communication on the different therapeutic modalities, as well as an increased exchange of experiences, which could lead to an improvement in the quality of burn treatment in Belgium.\n",

      "Two small conductance, calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels), SK2 and SK3, have been shown to contribute to the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and to shape the firing behavior in neurons for example in the hippocampal formation, the dorsal vagal nucleus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the cerebellum. In heterologous expression systems, SK2 and SK3 currents are blocked by the bee venom toxin apamin, just as well as the corresponding neuronal AHP currents. However, the functional role and pharmacological profile of SK1 channels from rat brain (rSK1) is still largely unknown, as so far rSK1 homomeric channels could not be functionally expressed. We have performed a domain analysis to elucidate the pharmacological profile and the molecular determinants of rSK1 channel expression by using channel chimeras in combination with immunocytochemistry, immunoblot analysis, and electrophysiology. Our results reveal that the rSK1 subunit is synthesized in cells but does not form functional homomeric channels. Exchanging the carboxyl terminus of rSK1 for that of hSK1 or rSK2 is sufficient to rescue the functional expression of rSK1 channels. Additionally, transplantation of both amino and carboxyl termini of rSK1 onto hSK1 subunits, normally forming functional homomeric channel, hinders their functional expression, while hSK1 channels containing only the rSK1 carboxyl terminus are functional. These results suggest that the lack of functional expression of rSK1 channels is probably due to problems in their assembly and tetramerization but not in their calmodulin-dependent gating. Finally, we show that chimeric channels containing the core domain (S1–S6) of rSK1, unlike hSK1, are apamin-insensitive.\n",

      "In a retrospective study of 223 testis cancer survivors and 120 controls matched sociodemographically, we examined the relative impact of sociodemographic and clinical factors on long‐term outcomes in the areas of sexual function, relationships, employment, and mental outlook. For most of the survivors, testis cancer did not lead to unemployment (4.5%), divorce (6.8%), or disabling psychological problems. Multivariate analysis results confirm that cancer survivors report significantly more infertility and sexual performance distress, but not more desire distress, than the control group. Survivors' sexual impairment varied according to treatment received (and therefore histologic factors) and sociodemographic variables. Parental status (not having children) and education (college or less) independently predict infertility distress, whereas education and lower occupational level independently predicted sexual performance distress. Adjusting for socioeconomic status (SES), the men with advanced testis cancer who received chemotherapy and standard retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) had significantly more infertility and performance distress than those men who received other treatments. Neither the treatment or SES variables predicted disrupted relationships or a deteriorated mental outlook. However, men with sexual impairment distress were more likely to report strained relationships and a pessimistic mental outlook. These findings have implications for treatment decisions and can be used to identify subgroups of survivors who could benefit from counseling and sexual rehabilitation services.\n",

      "Objective. To measure self-reported physical and mental functioning and associated clinical features at study entry in 3 ethnic groups with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods. Sixty Hispanic, 39 African American, and 104 Caucasian patients with recent-onset SSc (< 5 yrs) were assessed for perceived physical and mental functioning, using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Scleroderma-Health Assessment Questionnaire (Scleroderma-HAQ). Socioeconomic, demographic, clinical, immunologic, immunogenetic, behavioral, and psychological variables (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, ISEL; Illness Behavior Questionnaire, IBQ; and Arthritis Helplessness Index, AHI) were analyzed by linear regression models for associations with SF-36 and mHAQ scores as dependent variables. Results. Perceived physical functioning scores had ethnic-specific associations with AHI > fatigue scores > IBQ > clinical variables (hypertension, skin score, and percentage predicted DLCO). Scleroderma-HAQ scores had ethnic-specific associations with IBQ > AHI scores > most clinical and laboratory variables. Decreased mental component summary (MCS) scores associated with AHI > ISEL. Ethnic-specific immunogenetic variables HLA-DQB1*0202 (Caucasian) and HLA-DRB 1*11 (African American), and HLA-DQA1*0501 (Hispanic) also associated with MCS. Antinuclear autoantibodies, anti-topoisomerase I, and RNA polymerases I and III also demonstrated associations with functioning in African American and Hispanic groups. Conclusion. Clinical, psychosocial, and immunogenetic variables had ethnic-specific associations with perceived physical and mental functioning. Consideration of ethnic-specific psychological and behavioral support in designing more personalized, relevant therapeutic interventions for the patient may improve therapeutic efficacy in SSc.\n",

      "The clinical features of urticaria and anaphylaxis are similar, and they share common causal immune‐mediated pathways. We aimed to investigate the risk of anaphylaxis among patients with urticaria. A 12‐year population‐based retrospective cohort study was conducted. Investigated subjects were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database by the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. We included 126 031 subjects with newly diagnosed urticaria and 252 062 matched controls between 2000 and 2013. Risk of anaphylaxis among patients with urticaria was calculated by calculating adjusted hazards ratios (HR) after matching for confounding comorbidities. Urticaria was more common in women than it was in men (58% vs 42%), with a peak onset age of 20–40 years. The number of comorbidities including asthma, allergic rhinitis, herpes zoster, hepatitis B and C, rheumatoid arthritis and gout were higher in patients with urticaria than that in age‐ and sex‐matched controls. The crude HR for anaphylaxis among urticaria subjects was 2.883 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.787–2.982; P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders which have been proposed to increase the risk of anaphylaxis, patients with urticaria were found to be at a significantly high risk of anaphylaxis with an adjusted HR of 2.529 (95% CI, 2.442–2.619; P < 0.001). We conclude that the incidence rate of anaphylaxis is significantly high in patients with urticaria in Taiwan.\n",

      "There is a paucity of clinical data available on specific treatment in the oncogeriatric population with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate treatment patterns and survival outcomes in the elderly to address any disparities at our community hospital. We retrospectively identified a total of 1749 patients diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at our institution between 2001 and 2011. Patient demographics, surgical treatment, stage of disease, tumor characteristics, adjuvant therapy, and 5-year survival data were obtained from tumor registry records. Comparisons between study groups were made using the Pearson χ2 test and Student's t test. We found more favorable prognostic makers among women older than 70 years of age. Of the women with lymph node-positive disease, 84 per cent of those younger than 70 years and 33 per cent in the older than 70 years of age study group received chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy were more frequently performed in the younger group. Overall 5-year survival was 90 per cent and 71 per cent for younger than 70 years and older than 70 years groups, respectively. Women older than 70 years of age have more favorable breast cancer characteristics compared with younger women and received less aggressive treatment and experienced a higher mortality rate. Prospective trials are needed to assess the impact of aggressive multimodality therapy in this oncogeriatric population.\n",

      "Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (CAAMR) is an intermediate process that occurs during the development of chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAMR), which is a key problem associated with the long-term kidney grafts survival. This study investigated the role played by PC3-secreted microprotein (PSMP) in the progression of CAAMR and CAMR. We showed that CAAMR and CAMR patients’ allografts dysfunction with declined survival rate, which suggested that earlier diagnosis and treatment of CAAMR might be important to prevent irreversible chronic injury of CAMR progression. We found PSMP was an important factor in the development of chronic antibody-mediated rejection. The PSMP expression increased significantly in CAAMR biopsy samples but not in CAMR and control patients, which distinguished CAAMR patients from CAMR and non-rejection patients. Moreover, our results showed that infiltration of CD68+ macrophages in CAAMR increased, and the correlation between CD68+ macrophages and PSMP expression in CAAMR patients was significant. Additionally, our data also revealed that intimal arteritis (v-lesion) accompanied by increased macrophage infiltration might have contributed to more graft loss in CAAMR, and PSMP expression was significantly associated with the v-lesion score. These results indicated that PSMP played an important role in the recruitment of macrophages and promote intimal arteritis inducing allograft lost in CAAMR progression. In future study PSMP could be a potential histopathological diagnostic biomarker and treatment target for CAAMR in kidney transplantation.\n",

      "The penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Clostridium perfringens were studied. Six PBPs ranging in molecular weight from approximately 42,000 to 100,000 were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane. The relative affinities of the PBPs for 16 beta-lactam antibiotics were determined. Most of the drug saturated PBP 3 and 4 at concentrations equal to their minimal inhibitory concentrations, suggesting that these PBPs are the killing targets for beta-lactams. Mecillinam showed unique properties; it had a higher affinity for PBP 5 than for other PBPs, and it was the only agent tested which caused inhibition of growth without saturating PBP 4. Interestingly, all beta-lactam antibiotics tested induced filament formation despite having different binding patterns to the PBPs of C. perfringens.\n",

      "Objective—Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a promising treatment for ischemic injury. However, the environmental regulatory mechanism is essentially unclear and thus greatly limits its application in clinical setting. Accumulating evidence suggests a vital role of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) in microenvironment homeostasis after ischemia. About 540 million people or 8% of population worldwide carry a loss-of-function allele of ALDH2. It is unknown whether ALDH2 functions as a host factor regulating the therapeutic potential of donor MSCs. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether and how host ALDH2 regulates MSC retention and therapeutic efficacy after transplantation into ischemic tissues. Approach and Results—Mice limb ischemia was performed by femoral artery ligation. A total of 106 MSCs were injected into the ischemic thigh muscles. One, 2, and 4 weeks after transplantation, MSC retention, blood perfusion recovery, limb necrosis, and fibrosis were analyzed. Compared with wild-type tissue, ALDH2 deficiency tissue significantly limited MSC retention and its perfusion recovery and limb salvage effects after ischemia. Importantly, local overexpression of ALDH2 optimized tissue microenvironment and significantly magnified all these MSC-induced improvement. Further study indicated that host ALDH2 regulated transplanted MSC survival and therapy as a microenvironment homeostasis mediator via local capillary density, energy supply, and oxidative stress regulating after ischemia. Conclusions—Our study establishes ALDH2 as a key mediator of host stem cell niche for optimal MSC therapy and suggests that ALDH2 deficiency present in the general population is a limiting host factor to be considered for MSC therapy.\n",

      "The majority of neurons in primary visual cortex respond selectively to bars of light that have a specific orientation and move in a specific direction. The spatial and temporal responses of such neurons are non-separable. How neurons accomplish that computational feat without resort to explicit time delays is unknown. We propose a novel neural mechanism whereby visual cortex computes non-separable responses by generating endogenous traveling waves of neural activity that resonate with the space-time signature of the visual stimulus. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the response are defined by the local topology of excitatory and inhibitory lateral connections in the cortex. We simulated the interaction between endogenous traveling waves and the visual stimulus using spatially distributed populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with Wilson-Cowan dynamics and inhibitory-surround coupling. Our model reliably detected visual gratings that moved with a given speed and direction provided that we incorporated neural competition to suppress false motion signals in the opposite direction. The findings suggest that endogenous traveling waves in visual cortex can impart direction-selectivity on neural responses without resort to explicit time delays. They also suggest a functional role for motion opponency in eliminating false motion signals. Author summary It is well established that the so-called ‘simple cells’ of the primary visual cortex respond preferentially to oriented bars of light that move across the visual field with a particular speed and direction. The spatiotemporal responses of such neurons are said to be non-separable because they cannot be constructed from independent spatial and temporal neural mechanisms. Contemporary theories of how neurons compute non-separable responses typically rely on finely tuned transmission delays between signals from disparate regions of the visual field. However the existence of such delays is controversial. We propose an alternative neural mechanism for computing non-separable responses that does not require transmission delays. It instead relies on the predisposition of the cortical tissue to spontaneously generate spatiotemporal waves of neural activity that travel with a particular speed and direction. We propose that the endogenous wave activity resonates with the visual stimulus to elicit direction-selective neural responses to visual motion. We demonstrate the principle in computer models and show that competition between opposing neurons robustly enhances their ability to discriminate between visual gratings that move in opposite directions.\n",

      "Disk diffusion tests, inoculated directly from positive blood cultures, were evaluated for accuracy of reading zone diameters after 4- and 6-h and overnight incubation. In comparisons with results from standard disk diffusion tests, the 4-h results were in agreement for 83% of tests with gram-positive organisms and 64% of tests with gram-negative organisms. When minor discrepancies were ignored, the 4-h readings were in agreement for 98% of the tests with gram-positive organisms and 95% of the tests with gram-negative organisms. After 6 h of incubation, 91% of the tests with gram-positive organisms and 86% of the tests with gram-negative organisms agreed with standard results. The agreement was 99% for tests with both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms when minor discrepancies were excluded. Very major discrepancies occurred in two tests (0.1%) with gram-positive organisms and were not observed in tests with gram-negative organisms. The frequencies of major discrepancies were 3.5% after 4 h, 0.6% after 6 h, and 0.7% after overnight incubation. Ampicillin and cephalothin tests with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. accounted for 81% of the major discrepancies in tests with gram-negative organisms. Oxacillin tests accounted for more than half of the major discrepancies in tests with staphylococci. The results of this study, which did not include the newer antibiotics, indicate that direct susceptibility tests from blood cultures read after 6 h of incubation are more reliable than 4-h results and produce less than 1% major errors in comparisons with standard susceptibility tests.\n",

      "Background/Aims The ability of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to resect large early gastric cancers (EGCs) results in the need to treat large artificial gastric ulcers. This study assessed whether the combination therapy of rebamipide plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) offered benefits over PPI monotherapy. Methods In this prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, and comparative study, patients who had undergone ESD for EGC or gastric adenoma were randomized into groups receiving either rabeprazole monotherapy (10 mg/day, n=64) or a combination of rabeprazole plus rebamipide (300 mg/day, n=66). The Scar stage (S stage) ratio after treatment was compared, and factors independently associated with ulcer healing were identified by using multivariate analyses. Results The S stage rates at 4 and 8 weeks were similar in the two groups, even in the subgroups of patients with large amounts of tissue resected and regardless of CYP2C19 genotype. Independent factors for ulcer healing were circumferential location of the tumor and resected tissue size; the type of treatment did not affect ulcer healing. Conclusions Combination therapy with rebamipide and PPI had limited benefits compared with PPI monotherapy in the treatment of post-ESD gastric ulcer (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000007435).\n",

      "This study was performed to investigate the antioxidant activities of Nymphaea nouchali flower (NNF) extract and the underlying mechanism using RAW 264.7 cells. The presence of gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, caffeic acid, quercetin, and apigenin in the NNF was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The extract had a very potent capacity to scavenge numerous free radicals. NNF extract was also able to prevent DNA damage and quench cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) with no signs of toxicity. The NNF extract was able to augment the expression of both primary and phase II detoxifying enzyme, resulting in combat the oxidative stress. This is accomplished by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) (p38 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) followed by enhancing the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This attenuates cellular ROS generation and confers protection from cell death. Altogether, the results of current study revealed that Nymphaea nouchali flower could be a source of natural phytochemicals that could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for preventing oxidative stress associated diseases and attenuating disease progression.\n",

      "Acute asthma exacerbations occur relatively frequently in children. We present the case of a 4-year-old boy who was admitted to our hospital in status asthmaticus and found to have a wide complex rhythm while being treated with inhaled albuterol and intravenous methylprednisolone. This rhythm was diagnosed as accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), which carries a benign prognosis. It resolved as the medications used to treat his asthma exacerbation were weaned. There was no ventricular ectopy seen on a 24-hour Holter monitor performed 3 months after his hospitalization, suggesting that the AIVR was related to the medications the patient was receiving at the time. This case suggests that albuterol may be a risk factor for the development of AIVR and highlights the importance of recognizing this rhythm to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful therapies.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE. We attempted to obtain baseline data on the incidence of intussusception and its association with gastroenteritis in a cross-sectional observational study in children. METHODS. Admissions to all 38 pediatric units in Switzerland because of intussusception were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit from April 2003 to March 2006. Patient and disease characteristics were assessed prospectively with the use of a standardized questionnaire based on the case definition for intussusception developed by the Brighton Collaboration. Completeness of reporting was verified through capture-recapture analysis. RESULTS. There were 294 patients with reported intussusception; 35 cases were excluded for various reasons, and 29 additional patients were identified through International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes. After capture-recapture analysis, we estimated underreporting to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit to be 32% and we calculated a true number of 381 intussusception episodes. The highest level of diagnostic certainty was reached by 248 patients, and 20 fulfilled level 2 criteria; for the remaining 20 patients, available information was insufficient. The mean age of the patients was 2.7 years. The yearly mean incidence of intussusception was 38, 31, and 26 cases per 100000 live births in the first, second, and third year of life, respectively, with no apparent seasonality. Seventy patients had a history of coinciding gastroenteritis, and 5 of 61 tested positive for rotavirus. Spontaneous devagination was observed for 38 patients; enemas reduced intussusception successfully in 183 cases, whereas surgical treatment was required in 67. All patients recovered without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS. This is the first prospective nationwide surveillance of intussusception in childhood using a standardized case definition. Most cases occurred beyond infancy, and association with rotavirus gastroenteritis was rare.\n"

hemangiomas are rare benign vascular lesions that mainly affect the head, neck, and hands. the lesion shows a striking predilection for the mucosa, while skin is the second common site for the lesions. Granulation  hemangiomas occur upon various stimuli such as chronic  irritation, traumatic injury, and hormonal factors. The lesions occur predominantly in young females, possibly triggered by a vascular effect due to hormonal changes. They range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters and can grow rapidly with frequently bleeding.

      "Granulation tissue‐type hemangiomas are rare benign vascular lesions that mainly affect the head, neck, and hands. In 75% of the cases, the lesion shows a striking predilection for the mucosa, while skin is the second common site for the lesions. Granulation tissue‐type hemangiomas occur upon various stimuli such as chronic low‐grade irritation, traumatic injury, and hormonal factors. The lesions occur predominantly in young females, possibly triggered by a vascular effect due to hormonal changes.

      "Introduction: Sinus pericranii (SP) involves transosseous vessels that connect the intra- and extracranial venous systems. Accessory-type SP can be cured by surgical or endovascular treatment. Reports of recurrence are, however, rare. Case: A boy presented with a soft-tissue mass on the left parietal region of the head. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the congenital SP with several small transosseous vessels surrounded by an area of thin bone. At the initial surgery, the vascular mass was completely excised by coagulating and cutting the transosseous vessels. The skull defect was filled with bone wax. Two years later, SP recurred at the same site. At the second surgery, the skull defect and surrounding area were sealed with acrylic resin. The boy has been followed up for 6 years without recurrence. Discussion: Potential risk factors for recurrence proposed in the existing literature include an unusually large number of emissary veins, rich circulation between intra- and extracranial venous systems, large bone defects, raised intracranial pressure, and association of other developmental venous anomalies. Our case demonstrates that thin skull bone around the original lesion can be another risk factor for recurrence. Conclusion: Removing all abnormal vessels and sealing the skull defect as well as the surrounding thin bone area are important to prevent recurrence of congenital SP.\n",
      "Calciphylaxis, or calcification uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare disease thought to occur due to arteriolar calcifications of the dermis and is responsible for ischemia with cutaneous necrosis and painful panniculitis. Its mechanism remains poorly understood which makes its management challenging and difficult to standardize. We report our management of two patients diagnosed with calciphylaxis. In one patient, calciphylaxis was mentioned upon admission given the context of preexisting secondary hyperparathyroidism and the existence of multiple risk factors. In both patients, the diagnosis was confirmed histologically. Our two observations highlight the difficulty of the diagnosis and the complexity of the therapeutic management that has been personalized according to patient characteristics and clinical evolution. Several therapeutic means can be implemented once the diagnosis is made; nevertheless, its prognosis remains pejorative despite the therapeutic advances. Broad debridement, good phosphocalcic balance control, and the correction of the risk factors top the list of any therapeutic strategy. One of the major challenges of the therapy is normalizing the calcium-phosphate balance. Thus, Cinacalcet and sodium thiosulfate appear to be promising treatments.\n",
      "Melorheostosis is a rare dysostosis involving cortical bone overgrowth that affects the appendicular skeleton. Patients present with pain, deformities, contractures, range of motion limitation(s), and limb swelling. It has been described in children as well as adults. We recently identified somatic mosaicism for gain‐of‐function mutations in MAP2K1 in patients with melorheostosis. Despite these advances in genetic understanding, there are no effective therapies or clinical guidelines to help clinicians and patients in disease management. In a study to better characterize the clinical and genetic aspects of the disease, we recruited 30 adults with a radiographic appearance of melorheostosis and corresponding increased uptake on 18F‐NaF positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. Patients underwent physical exam, imaging studies, and laboratory assessment. All patients underwent nerve conduction studies and ultrasound imaging of the nerve in the anatomic distribution of melorheostosis. We found sensory deficits in approximately 77% of patients, with evidence of focal nerve entrapment in five patients. All patients reported pain; 53% of patients had changes in skin overlying the affected bone. No significant laboratory abnormalities were noted. Our findings suggest that patients with melorheostosis may benefit from a multidisciplinary team of dermatologists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, pain and palliative care specialists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists. Future studies focused on disease management are needed. © 2019 The Authors. JBMR Plus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n",
      "Necrotic lesions in the periventricular region of children dying in the first month of life, first noted by Virchow (1867) were investigated extensively by Schwartz (1958). Banker and Larroche (1962) made a detailed study of the topography of these lesions and the sequence of histological changes, and found that in 70 per cent of cases there was a history of an episode of severe cyanosis during the neonatal period caused by apnoea or cardiac arrest. Moreoever the pathological changes were compatible with anoxic damage occurring at the time of these episodes.\n"
