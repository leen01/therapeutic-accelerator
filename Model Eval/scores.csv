1,7465525,chromosome territories (CTs) have been conserved during primate evolution. CTs contain mainly gene-dense and early replicating chromatin. the position of CTs in human lymphocyte nuclei is correlated with gene density. this suggests a functionally relevant higher-order arrangement.,"We demonstrate that the nuclear topological arrangement of chromosome territories (CTs) has been conserved during primate evolution over a period of about 30 million years. Recent evidence shows that the positioning of chromatin in human lymphocyte nuclei is correlated with gene density. For example, human chromosome 19 territories, which contain mainly gene-dense and early replicating chromatin, are located toward the nuclear center, whereas chromosome 18 territories, which consist mainly of gene-poor and later replicating chromatin, is located close to the nuclear border. In this study, we subjected seven different primate species to comparative analysis of the radial distribution pattern of human chromosome 18- and 19-homologous chromatin by three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our data demonstrate that gene-density-correlated radial chromatin arrangements were conserved during higher-primate genome evolution, irrespective of the major karyotypic rearrangements that occurred in different phylogenetic lineages. The evolutionarily conserved positioning of homologous chromosomes or chromosome segments in related species supports evidence for a functionally relevant higher-order chromatin arrangement that is correlated with gene-density.",0.024647457147841195,0.7105263157894737,0.15606936416184972,0.2559241706161138
2,143460832,the degree of reproducibility of treatment effects across experiments was assessed. no evidence that treatment effects were greater for behavioral measures than for nonbehavioral ones. a serious limitation upon the significance test for assessing the reproducibility was pointed out. the results of the collaborative Behavioral teratology study were analyzed in terms of conventional significance tests.,"The data of the Collaborative Behavioral Teratology Study were reanalyzed. The degree of reproducibility of the treatment effect across experiments was assessed as the magnitude of fluctuation in strength of association (η2) for the replication experiment. There was no evidence that fluctuation of treatment effects across experiments was greater for behavioral measures than for nonbehavioral ones, suggesting the conventional belief that low reproducibility of results in behavioral teratology reflects the low reliability of the behavior test per se is unwarranted. Although the distributions of obtained treatment effects were almost symmetric and unimodal for most measures, the ranges were considerable. Considering that experiments were conducted under strictly standardized conditions across experiments, finding of the considerable ranges indicates that inconsistency in results across experiments cannot be remedied adequately by employing solely a standardized method. Basing in the main their results in terms of conventional significance tests, research workers in the collaborative study concluded that excellent reproducibility of behavioral data was demonstrated. The logic underlying the statistically nonsignificant interaction used in the original work was examined critically. A serious limitation upon the significance test for assessing the reproducibility of results was pointed out, and a warning issued about customary reliance only on a significance test.",0.06278510265416241,0.8148148148148148,0.21890547263681592,0.34509803921568627

The high rates of asymptomatic and mild infections complicate assessment of cause of death in CYP. We assessed the cause of death in all CYP with a positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test since the start of the pandemic in England. Methods and findings CYP aged <20 years who died within 100 days of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 01 March 2020 and 31 December 2021 in England were followed up in detail, using national databases, surveillance questionnaires, post-mortem reports, and clinician interviews. There were 185 deaths during the 22-month follow-up and 81 (43.8%) were due to COVID-19. Compared to non-COVID-19 deaths in CYP with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, death due to COVID-19 was independently associated with older age (aOR 1.06 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.11, p = 0.02) and underlying comorbidities (aOR 2.52 95% CI 1.27 to 5.01, p = 0.008), after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity group, and underlying conditions, with a shorter interval between SARS-CoV-2 testing and death. Half the COVID-19 deaths (41/81, 50.6%) occurred within 7 days of confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 91% (74/81) within 30 days. Of the COVID-19 deaths, 61 (75.3%) had an underlying condition, especially severe neurodisability (n = 27) and immunocompromising conditions (n = 12). Over the 22-month surveillance period, SARS-CoV-2 was responsible for 1.2% (81/6,790) of all deaths in CYP aged <20 years, with an infection fatality rate of 0.70/100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections in this age group estimated through real-time, nowcasting modelling, and a mortality rate of 0.61/100,000. Limitations include possible under-ascertainment of deaths in CYP who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 and lack of direct access to clinical data for hospitalised CYP. Conclusions COVID-19 deaths remain extremely rare in CYP, with most fatalities occurring within 30 days of infection and in children with specific underlying conditions.",0.002821353007805534,0.9411764705882353,0.13259668508287292,0.2324455205811138

Its debilitating course has led to the search for new treatments, including antifungals and monoclonal antibodies. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of antifungal treatments in patients with ABPA and either asthma or cystic fibrosis, we performed a systematic review of the literature on the effects of antifungal agents in ABPA using three biomedical databases. Quality assessment was performed using the GRADE methodology and, where appropriate, studies with comparable outcomes were pooled for meta‐analysis. Thirty‐eight studies – four randomized controlled trials and 34 observational studies – met the eligibility criteria. The antifungal interventions described were itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, ketoconazole, natamycin, nystatin and amphotericin B. An improvement in symptoms, frequency of exacerbations and lung function was reported in most of the studies and was more common with oral azoles. Antifungals also had a positive impact on biomarkers and radiological pulmonary infiltrates, but adverse effects were also common. The quality of the evidence supporting these results was low or very low due to a shortage of controlled studies, heterogeneity between studies and potential bias. Antifungal interventions in ABPA improved patient and disease outcomes in both asthma and cystic fibrosis. However, the recommendation for their use is weak and clinicians should therefore weigh up desirable and undesirable effects on a case‐by‐case basis. More studies with a better methodology are needed, especially in cystic fibrosis, to increase confidence in the effects of antifungal treatments in ABPA.",0.022182502370660113,0.9411764705882353,0.1927710843373494,0.32

ENoG and grading score were significant prognostic predictors. 85% degeneration had the best specificity and sensitivity to predict nonrecovery.,"Objective: To search for prognostic predictors and reexamine the usefulness of electroneurography (ENoG) in predicting the prognosis of peripheral facial palsy using statistical methods. Study Design: Prospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Consecutive 142 patients with Bell's palsy and 26 with Ramsay Hunt syndrome treated with steroid plus antiviral agents. Interventions: Multivariate analysis was used to identify which factors, including Yanagihara grading score and ENoG, predict better recovery. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for ENoG and grading score. The cumulative recovery rate by ENoG was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Recovery was defined as the improvement of grading score to 36 points or more (full score, 40) without synkinesis. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed that Ramsay Hunt syndrome, the worst grading score and ENoG were the significant prognostic predictors. The area under the ROC curve for ENoG was broader than those for grading score, indicating that ENoG was superior to grading score in terms of accuracy for prognosis prediction. The ROC curve revealed that more than 85% degeneration on ENoG had the best specificity (77.8%) and sensitivity (71.4%) to predict nonrecovery. When ENoG was subjected to the analysis of cumulative recovery rate using Kaplan-Meier plots, patients with more than 85% degeneration on ENoG had significantly poorer prognosis. Conclusion: ENoG was the most effective factor for prediction of the prognosis of peripheral facial palsy, and more than 85% degeneration had the best specificity and sensitivity to predict nonrecovery.",0.0029410531812222207,0.8285714285714286,0.11983471074380166,0.20938628158844766

In any case, upon heating, kinetic products 5 and 7 are transformed into the corresponding thermodynamic products 6 and 8, respectively. The electron-donating ability of the Cp ring is a relevant controlling parameter: a strong π-donor character facilitates the isomerization process. In addition, the nature of the silicon substituents in the silsesquioxane framework, the type of solvent, and the reaction temperature are also factors that significantly affect this process. Cyclopentadienyl–silsesquioxane complexes 6b and 8b are efficient and selective catalysts for epoxidation with aqueous hydrogen peroxide under mild conditions.

The diagnosis was made sonographically at 22 weeks of gestation and the natural course of the hemorrhage was followed. Interestingly, the final sonographic appearance of the posterior fossa was quite similar to that of the classic form of Dandy–Walker malformation: absence of the vermis and an enlarged fourth ventricle. However, careful sonographic examination showed that the enlargement of the fourth ventricle was actually caused by a porencephalic cystic lesion of the left cerebellar lobe.

Method: Twenty-one PWAs ranging from 47 to 91 years of age with post-onset periods of 2 months to 14 years were tested using standardized and criterion-measure tools to assess their language and cognitive functions, QoL, and QoCL. Additionally, participants completed a demographics questionnaire, which also included information on their stroke and the kinds of therapies they had received. Assessments were conducted over two sessions with randomized order of test administrations to control fatigue and order effects. Results and Discussions: Correlation-matrix was used to determine the strength of relations between test measures. The impact of QoL related factors (viz., aphasia severity, cognitive functioning, time post-onset, and therapy received) on QoCL was examined using ANOVAs. The ASHA Quality of Communication Life Scale (ASHA-QCL) had more significant correlations with other QoL measures than the ASHA-Functional Assessment of Communication Skills (ASHA-FACS). Aphasia severity, cognitive deficits, and therapy received contributed significantly to QoL and QoCL in PWAs. Conclusions: Evaluating overall QoL may not fully reveal the QoCL in PWAs. Measuring QoCL specifically is crucial in aphasia interventions, and it is equally important to use sensitive tools that can capture the QoCL effectively. ASHA-QCL was more effective than ASHA-FACS in capturing the QoCL.

Both proteins originate from a common L-proline-specific ancestor, but LmbC was evolutionary adapted to use an unusual substrate, (2S,4R)-4-propyl-proline (PPL). Using site-directed mutagenesis of the LmbC substrate binding pocket and an ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assay, three residues, G308, A207 and L246, were identified as crucial for the PPL activation, presumably forming together a channel of a proper size, shape and hydrophobicity to accommodate the propyl side chain of PPL. Subsequently, we experimentally simulated the molecular evolution leading from L-proline-specific substrate binding pocket to the PPL-specific LmbC. The mere change of three amino acid residues in originally strictly L-proline-specific CcbC switched its substrate specificity to prefer PPL and even synthetic alkyl-L-proline derivatives with prolonged side chain. This is the first time that such a comparative study provided an evidence of the evolutionary relevant adaptation of the adenylation domain substrate binding pocket to a new sterically different substrate by a few point mutations. The herein experimentally simulated rearrangement of the substrate binding pocket seems to be the general principle of the de novo genesis of adenylation domains’ unusual substrate specificities.

Our study patients were Javanese in ethnicity, which constitute half of population in Indonesia. We hypothesized that elevated blood glucose has detrimental effects on hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome. Methods We designed an observasional cohort study and recruited 148 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome. Venous blood was collected on hospital arrival. High blood glucose level was determined as plasma glucose > 140 mg/dL. Adverse hospitalization events were recorded, i.e. mortality, acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock and heart rhythm disorders. Echocardiography examination was performed to determine left ventricular function. Results The prevalence of on arrival high blood glucose among Javanese patients with acute coronary syndrome was considerably high (36%). On arrival high blood glucose was associated with acute heart failure (P < 0.001) and shock cardiogenic (P = 0.02). Heart rhythm disorders were higher in high blood glucose patients (P = 0.004). Left ventricular dysfunction was more prevalent in high blood glucose patients (P = 0.001) and ejection fraction was lower (P = 0.001). On arrival high blood glucose was independently associated with hospitalization adverse events (adjusted odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-4.9, P = 0.03) and hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 6.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-38.6, P = 0.03). Conclusions Our study suggests that on arrival high blood glucose among Javanese patients with acute coronary syndrome is considerably high and is associated with detrimental and fatal hospitalization outcomes.",0.02215355593088412,0.8181818181818182,0.16728624535315986,0.27777777777777785

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was carried out using a single‐voxel STEAM sequence and dynamic imaging was carried out using a combination of pre‐contrast proton density‐weighted FSPGR images (to remove the influence of native tissue T1), bolus injection of Gd‐DTPA and subsequent T1‐weighted FSPGR dynamic imaging. A two‐compartment pharmacokinetic model was employed to determine vascular characteristics. Results obtained from 12 meningiomas suggest a possible correlation between the level of lipids/macromolecules and permeability surface area product, although the confounding issue of extra‐voxel contamination arising from lipids in the scalp and skull marrow cannot be ruled out in the more superficial lesions. Results obtained from 11 gliomas (four low and seven high grade) demonstrate that permeability surface area product is not specific for the range of vascular characteristics and metabolite profiles observed in gliomas and is therefore unable to explain metabolic heterogeneity in these lesions.

However, The research demonstrates that the low speed of naming is an effective indicator of neurocognitive problems of information processing as a whole (learning difficulties in general), not just reading difficulties. This can be explained in two ways: disturbance of executive mental control and the difficulties of automatization: the difficulties of the transition from a controlled energy-consuming assignment to a less energy-consuming one.

Simulating the variation in such constraints, we have experimentally manipulated the rate of work (wheel running) mice must do to obtain their food, and studied the ensuing behavioural and physiological responses. This was done with a line of mice selectively bred for high spontaneous wheel running and a randomly bred control line that vary in the amount of baseline wheel-running activity. We first determined the maximum workload for each individual. The maximum workload animals could engage in was around 23 km d–1 in both control and activity-selected mice, and was not associated with baseline wheel-running activity. We then kept mice at 90% of their individual maximum and measured several physiological and behavioural traits. At this high workload, mice increased wheel-running activity from an average of 10 to 20 km d–1, and decreased food intake and body mass by approximately 20%. Mass-specific resting metabolic rate strongly decreased from 1.43 to 0.98 kJ g–1 d–1, whereas daily energy expenditure slightly increased from 2.09 to 2.25 kJ g–1 d–1. Costs of running decreased from 2.3 to 1.6 kJ km–1 between baseline and workload conditions. At high workloads, animals were in a negative energy balance, resulting in a sharp reduction in fat mass as well as a slight decrease in dry lean mass. In addition, corticosterone levels increased, and body temperature was extremely low in some animals at high workloads. When challenged to work for food, mice thus show significant physiological and behavioural adjustments.",0.019709998836041197,0.9464285714285714,0.1872791519434629,0.31268436578171094

Dedicated cellular import, transport and homeostasis systems assure that the needed metal ion is correctly delivered and inserted into the target proteins and avoid the presence of free metal ions in the cell, preventing oxidative damaging. Among metal ions, in eukaryotic organisms copper and iron are required by proteins involved in absolutely essential functions, such as respiration, oxidative stress protection, catalysis, gene expression regulation. Copper and iron binding proteins are localized in essentially all cellular compartments. Copper is physiologically present mainly as individual metal ion. Iron can be present both as individual metal ion or as part of cofactors, such as hemes and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. Both metal ions are characterized by the ability to cycle between different oxidation states, which enable them to catalyze redox reactions and to participate in electron transfer processes.

The hexahydrate form of PW12 was found to be the most promising catalyst which exhibited highest ester yield 87% for transesterification of waste cooking oil and ester yield 97% for esterification of long‐chain palmitic acid, respectively. The PW12 acid catalyst shows higher activity under the optimized reaction conditions compared with conventional homogeneous catalyst sulfuric acid, and can easily be separated from the products by distillation of the excess methanol and can be reused more times. The most important feature of this catalyst is that the catalytic activity is not affected by the content of free fatty acids (FFAs) and the content of water in the waste cooking oil and the transesterification can occur at a lower temperature (65°C), a lower methanol oil ratio (70:1) and be finished within a shorter time.

Combined genotypic and phenotypic analyses of clinical isolates revealed the presence of moderate levels of phenotypic resistance (between 4- and 50-fold) to 3TC in a subset of isolates that did not harbor the M184V mutation. Mutational cluster analysis and comparison with the phenotypic data revealed a significant correlation between moderate phenotypic 3TC resistance and an increased incidence of replacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid or alanine and of valine by isoleucine at residues 44 and 118 of reverse transcriptase, respectively. This occurred predominantly in those isolates harboring zidovudine resistance-associated mutations (41L, 215Y). The requirement of the combination of mutations 41L and 215Y with mutations 44D and 44A and/or 118I for phenotypic 3TC resistance was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments.

Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that γGTP was beneficial for detecting subjects who scored two or less on Breslow's index, at least in subjects aged 40 or more. γGTP was associated with insulin resistance level estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (p<0.0001), which was inversely associated with Breslow's index (p=0.0040). γGTP could be used as an objective substitute of Breslow's index, allowing us to identify subjects with low scores on Breslow's index, at least after sorting subjects properly.

This strategy involves the testing of hypotheses regarding expected consistencies within the data, and between the data and independent sources of information. Although the purpose of the job analysis is to obtain an empirical description of work patterns, some relationships among the data can be predicted with a high degree of confidence, and these predictions can then be used to test the validity of the job analysis data. An example investigates the validity of data collected as part of a job analysis for nurses. Licensure examinations (e.g., teacher certification) involve high stakes decisions about new graduates seeking to enter the professions. Such examinations can therefore have a strong impact on the institutions that prepare these graduates as well as on the settings in which they subsequently work. Empirical job analyses support claims for the validity of score interpretations for licensure and certification examinations by linking the content domain of the test directly to what is done in practice. The chapter on licensure and certification examinations in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1985) states that, ""a rationale should be provided to support a claim that the knowledge or skills being assessed are required for competent performance in an occupation"" (p. 64) and that ""Job analyses provide the primary basis for defining the content domain"" (p. 64).",0.034963133239040864,0.9642857142857143,0.2222222222222222,0.3612040133779264

This study was conducted to determine these risk factors. METHODS: In this nationwide, hospital-based, case-control study, the participants were all new MI patients hospitalized from April 2012 to March 2013 in Iran. The data on 1,691 new cases with HF (enrolled by census sampling) were compared with the data of 6,764 patients without HF as controls. We randomly selected four controls per one case, matched on the date at MI and HF diagnosis, according to incidence density sampling. Using conditional logistic regression models, odds ratios (ORs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to identify potential risk factors. RESULTS: The one-year in-hospital mortality rate was 18.2% in the cases and higher than in the controls (12.1%) (p<0.05). Significant risk factors for HF were: right bundle branch block (RBBB) (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.95 to 4.19), stroke (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.89), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.09).

This study aimed to determine the colonic adenoma detection rate (ADR) in patients with breast cancer. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients with breast cancer who underwent a colonoscopy between 2000 and 2017. A control group (n=3295), comprising cancer-free patients undergoing their first screening colonoscopy, was used for comparison. Results Of 62,820 breast cancer patients, 3304 met the inclusion criteria. The mean age at the time of first colonoscopy was 59 years. ADR was 55%; 1803 patients had adenomas.

These pztc values are compared to those obtained in sulfuric acid solutions. Whilst in the presence of bisulfate anions 
 the pztc decreases significantly as a consequence of the deposited palladium, in the case of perchloric acid solutions the pztc remains constant within experimental error.

To study the role of target neuron-specific factors in synaptogenesis, we used cocultures of presynaptic explants and dissociated target neurons from rat neocortex, which enabled us to selectively vary the postsynaptic target neurons. Cocultures containing target neurons that were obtained early during development [embryonic day 16 (E16)] were compared to cocultures containing target neurons that were obtained at a later embryonic stage (E19). Postsynaptic currents (PSCs) were evoked in target neurons by maximal extracellular stimulation in the presynaptic explant. The mean amplitudes of AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated PSCs were sixfold reduced in E16 target neurons, whereas the mean amplitudes of GABAAreceptor-mediated PSCs did not differ between E16 and E19 target neurons. This reduction was in part caused by an apparently twofold reduction in mean quantal amplitude, as shown by recording AMPA receptor-mediated miniature PSCs. In addition, a reduced number of glutamatergic release sites in E16 target neurons was revealed by synapsin I immunostaining of dendritic presynaptic terminals. No differences in mean release probability were observed between E16 and E19 target neurons. Thus, the formation of glutamatergic transmitter release sites was strongly influenced by target neuron-specific factors. The formation of functional GABAergic synapses, however, was independent of the type of target neurons, suggesting specific retrograde signaling during the establishment of glutamatergic synapses.",0.00850798516563852,0.7906976744186046,0.14049586776859505,0.2385964912280702

Therefore, the Royal Dutch Hockey Association (KNHB) made mouthguard use mandatory for field hockey players during competition and training from August 2015 onwards. This study evaluates the effects of the new regulations on mouthguard use and the occurrence of injuries in Dutch field hockey. Methods A 35-item online questionnaire about mouthguard use and orodental injuries was sent to 13 field hockey clubs in the Netherlands. Absolute numbers and percentages of mouthguard ownership, mouthguard use, number and type of injuries were assessed. The results were related to comparable data before mandatory mouthguard use. Associations of gender and training frequency with the number of injuries were analysed with logistic regression. Results In total, 1169 hockey players were included in the study and almost all owned a mouthguard (females:99.6%, males:93.7%), which significantly increased after implementation (p < 0.001). 90.6% of the respondents wore a mouthguard during matches and 70.1% during training. Of the 1169 players, 68(5.8%) experienced at least one orodental injury after the implementation with a total of 100 injuries.

Vasorelaxation was produced by the topical application of the calcium antagonist verapamil. Changes in the internal diameter of the basilar artery were determined by measuring the blood column diameter from photomicrographs taken sequentially, at 5 minute intervals, through the operating microscope. Changes in blood vessel diameter are expressed as a plus or minus percentage of the pretreatment diameter. Arterial blood pressure and blood gas values were kept in the physiological range for the cat. The subarachnoid injection of PRP-ADP produced severe constriction of the basilar artery (mean constriction at 5 minutes after injection: -40.7% ± 2.8 SEM). Platelet-free plasma, ADP alone and Elliott’s A solution had no spasmogenic effect when injected into the subarachnoid space. The topical application of the calcium channel blocker verapamil (0.1 mg per kg) 30 minutes after the injection of PRP-ADP, with the basilar artery still in spasm (mean constriction: -23% ± 3.5 SEM), produced prompt and dramatic vasodilation (mean dilation at 5 minutes after application: + 52.7% ±18.1 SEM). This spasmolytic effect persisted in a decremental fashion for the 60 minute period of observation, by which time the previously constricted vessel had returned to its normal size. These observations indicate that the platelet fraction of whole blood may be involved in the genesis of acute vasospasm following subarachnoid hemmorhage and that this phenomenon can be readily reversed by calcium antagonism.",0.010523721180753466,0.9361702127659575,0.16541353383458646,0.28115015974440893

Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor promotes brain plasticity and improves functional outcome after stroke in the young animal. Here, we test the hypothesis that sildenafil provides restorative therapeutic benefit to the aged animal. Methods— Male Wistar rats (aged, 18-month old; young, 3-month old) were subjected to embolic stroke. Saline or sildenafil was administered daily at a dose of 2 mg/kg orally or 10 mg/kg subcutaneously for 7 consecutive days starting 24 hour after stroke onset. Results— Aged rats exhibited significant impairment of functional recovery and reductions of vascular density, and endothelial cell proliferation compared with young rats. Aged rats treated with sildenafil at a dose of 10 mg/kg but not 2 mg/kg, showed significant improvements of functional recovery and concomitant increases in cortical cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) level, vascular density, endothelial cell proliferation, and synaptogenesis compared with aged rats treated with saline. In young rats, treatment with sildenafil at a dose of 2 or 10 mg/kg significantly enhanced functional recovery and amplified brain plasticity compared with young rats treated with saline.

We measured plasma concentrations of morphine and compared the efficacy and safety of continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) using morphine-bupivacaine with intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with morphine for 48 hrs after the end of the operation. Methods Nineteen patients undergoing Mile's operation were assigned to receive a morphine loading dose of 5 mg followed by IV-PCA with 0.1% morphine (IV-PCA group, n = 9) or a morphine loading dose of 2 mg and 0.125% bupivacaine 10 ml, followed by CEA with 0.004% morphine and 0.075% bupivacaine at a rate of 5 ml/hr (CEA group, n = 10). The plasma concentrations of morphine were measured and visual analog scales (VAS) for pain were recorded at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr postoperatively and the effects on respiration and any other side effects were noted. Results The mean maximal and minimal levels of plasma morphine were 40.2 ± 21.2 ng/ml and 23.4 ± 9.7 ng/ml for the IV-PCA group and 11.8 ± 3.5 ng/ml and 8.2 ± 1.9 ng/ml for the CEA group, respectively.

This study prospectively tested the association of PESP and mortality in cardiac patients. Methods and Results Consecutive patients (n=941; mean age, 61 years; 19% female) presenting with acute myocardial infarction were enrolled between May 2000 and March 2005 and followed up until August 2010. The main study outcome was 5‐year all‐cause mortality. Patients underwent noninvasive 30‐minute recordings of ECG and continuous blood pressure. PESP presence was based on the ratio between the first postectopic pulse wave amplitude and the mean of the subsequent 9 pulse wave amplitudes. A ratio above 1 was prospectively defined as PESP present. Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) suitable for PESP quantification were present in recordings of 220 patients. PESP was present in 62 of these patients. Patients without suitable VPCs were classified as PESP absent. During the follow‐up, 72 patients died. Among the 220 patients in whom PESP was measurable, 27 died. Under univariable analysis, PESP was a significant predictor of death (P<0.001) as were GRACE score (P<0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P<0.001), and the number of recorded VPCs (P<0.001). Under multivariable analysis, PESP (P<0.001), GRACE score (P<0.001), and LVEF (P=0.001) were independently associated with outcome. The combination of PESP presence and LVEF ≤35% identified a subgroup of patients with a particularly high mortality of 46.7%. Separate validation reproduced the finding in an unrelated population of 146 HF patients. Conclusions PESP, which likely reflects abnormalities of myocardial calcium cycling, predicts the mortality risk in postinfarction patients. Clinical Trial Registration URL: ClinicalTrials.gov.

The rate of isomerization of cis-1 z to trans-1 z depends on the catalytic precursor: Pd°(PPh 3 ) 4 > {Pd°(dba) 2 + 2PPh 3 } in agreement with an S N 2 mechanism in the rate-determining isomerization of the cationic (η 3 -allyl)palladium complexes formed in the oxidative addition. For a given precursor, the rate of isomerization of cis-lz to trans-1 z also depends on the substituent Z, i.e., on the leaving group. The isomerization rate follows the same order as the leaving group properties: 4-NO 2 -C 6 H 4 -CO 2 - > 4-Cl-C 6 H 4 -CO 2 - > C 6 H 5 -CO 2 - > 4-Me-C 6 H 4 -CO 2 - > 4-MeO-C 6 H 4 -CO 2 - .

Since T lymphocytes play a central role in respiratory allergic disorders, the measurement of serum levels of soluble IL‐2R may be useful in analysing the disease state of allergic disorders. The study has aimed at investigating the seasonal changes in serum soluble IL‐2R in 81 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis due to Japanese cedar pollens, with special reference to the effect of anti‐allergic pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy. Serum samples were obtained twice from each patient, before and during the pollen season, and all the serum samples were simultaneously used for determination of soluble IL‐2R and cedar pollen‐specific immunoglobin E (IgE). Seasonal elevation in soluble IL‐2R was not associated with the good clinical outcome but was associated with the poor clinical outcome, irrespective of pharmacotherapy or immunotherapy. Additionally, successful immunotherapy suppressed seasonal elevation of serum soluble IL‐2R more strongly than successful pharmacotherapy, and seasonal increase rates in soluble IL‐2R were inversely correlated with the duration of immunotherapy. Seasonal increase rates in soluble IL‐2R were significantly correlated with seasonal increase rates in specific IgE in both the medication group and the immunotherapy patients. These results may suggest that seasonal changes in serum soluble IL‐2R may serve as an indicator for clinical outcome of seasonal allergic rhinitis, that the magnitude of T cell activation could affect specific IgE production, and that T cell activation could be gradually modulated as immunotherapy proceeds.

In both animal and human studies, similar concentrations of volatile anesthetics have been associated with increased sensitivity to pain. Nicotinic analgesia is thought to involve the enhanced release of norepinephrine. These studies are intended as a “proof of concept” that alteration of the nicotinic facilitation of norepinephrine release is a potential mechanism for isoflurane-induced pronociception. METHODS:We conducted our study using a murine lumbar spinal cord slice model. We evoked norepinephrine release with nicotine in the presence and absence of isoflurane. To identify the type of nicotinic receptor involved, we studied the effect of receptor and subtype-specific ligands and genetically engineered mice, which lacked the gene expression for the nicotinic &bgr;2 subunit. The amount of [3H]-norepinephrine released was measured under the different conditions. RESULTS:Nicotine-facilitated norepinephrine release was significantly and maximally inhibited by isoflurane at concentrations that enhance pain sensitivity in vivo (0.38%). Facilitation of norepinephrine release was mimicked by the &agr;7 selective agonist choline and inhibited in the presence of &agr;-bungarotoxin, an &agr;7-nicotinic selective antagonist. Facilitation of norepinephrine release was not different in animals lacking &bgr;2 subunits compared with matched controls. CONCLUSIONS:Nicotinic facilitation of norepinephrine release in the spinal cord is inhibited by isoflurane at low clinically relevant concentrations. Because the net effect of noradrenergic tone in the spinal cord is inhibitory, the removal of this mechanism might be responsible for the enhanced pain sensitivity seen at these concentrations of isoflurane.",0.012822248085394844,0.8409090909090909,0.14624505928853754,0.24915824915824916

We review this case because of the success of PTD combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-positive IBC. Conclusion: To improve the poor prognosis of IBC, combined modality therapy is required, including chemotherapy and local treatment such as surgery and/or radiation therapy. In this case, combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy with PTD for HER2-positive IBC was effective, and this regimen may contribute to further improvements in the cure rate for this malignancy.",0.057486497329697045,0.9,0.23684210526315788,0.375

Both conditions may share an internal pathologic environment, also known as common soil. Their main pathophysiologic processes are oxidative stress, inflammation, and resultant insulin and leptin resistance. Moreover, the severity of ED is correlated with comorbid medical conditions, including obesity. Therefore, amelioration of these comorbidities may increase the efficacy of ED treatment with phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, the first-line medication for patients with ED. Although metformin was originally developed as an insulin sensitizer six decades ago, it has also been shown to improve leptin resistance. In addition, metformin has been reported to reduce oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and body weight, as well as improve ED, in animal and human studies. Moreover, administration of a combination of metformin and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors improves erectile function in patients with ED who have a poor response to sildenafil and are insulin resistant. Thus, concomitant treatment of metabolic derangements associated with obesity in patients with ED who are obese would improve the efficacy and reduce the refractory response to penile vasodilators. In this review, we discuss the connecting factors between obesity and ED and the possible combined treatment modalities.",0.044011454497204616,0.9166666666666666,0.22,0.3548387096774193

In this study, protease activities were measured as potential indicators of SM-induced skin injury in a hairless mouse sulfur mustard vapor exposure model. We also investigated the effects of synthetic protease inhibitors on SM-induced proteolytic activity. Skin homogenates prepared from hairless mouse dorsal skin exposed to SM vapor (1.4 g/m3) were assayed for serine and cysteine protease activities using synthetic chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates. Skin samples were obtained 24 h after SM challenge from animals exposed for either 6 or 12 min, while controls were obtained from unexposed skin. With 6 min SM-exposed skin, significantly higher elastase, tryptase, cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and calpain II enzymatic activities were detected compared to the unexposed control. With 12 min SM-exposed skin, significantly higher activities of elastase, tryptase, and calpain II were detected compared to the unexposed control. No significant differences were found between 6 and 12 min SM-induced protease activities, except 6-min cathepsin L, which was higher than the 12 min. Effective inhibitors include the general serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and specific peptide phosphonate serine protease inhibitors, in addition to peptide ketoamide transition-state cysteine protease inhibitors.

Nevertheless, the function of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FOXD2‐AS1 in HCC is still poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the role of FOXD2‐AS1 in HCC. We found that FOXD2‐AS1 was significantly upregulated in HCC cells in comparison to normal human liver cells, LO2. In this study, we also demonstrated that miR‐206 expression was greatly reduced in HCC cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of FOXD2‐AS1 repressed HCC cell proliferation, enhanced cell apoptosis, and restrained cell invasion and migration. The knockdown of FOXD2‐AS1 elevated miR‐206 expression, and we validated an interaction between these RNAs. Additionally, miR‐206 mimics inhibited HCC development while miR‐206 mimics had the opposite effect. MAP kinase 1 (MAP3K1) was predicted to be a target of miR‐206. We discovered that FOXD2‐AS1 modulated MAP3K1 expression by sponging miR‐206 in MHCC‐97L and HepG2 cells. Finally, our in vivo experiments validated that the knockdown of FOXD2‐AS1 inhibited HCC progression by modulating the miR‐206/MAP3K1 axis.

88,44880467,Ncopine is a brain specific protein with two C2 domains. it is upregulated by neuronal activity evoking hippocampal CA1 longterm potentiation. mRNA is expressed exclusively in neurons of the hippocampus and in the olfactory bulb.,"Abstract : N‐Copine is a novel protein with two C2 domains. Its expression is brain specific and up‐regulated by neuronal activity such as kainate stimulation and tetanus stimulation evoking hippocampal CA1 long‐term potentiation. We examined the localization and subcellular distribution of N‐copine in mouse brain. In situ hybridization analysis showed that N‐copine mRNA was expressed exclusively in neurons of the hippocampus and in the main and accessory olfactory bulb, where various forms of synaptic plasticity and memory formation are known to occur. In immunohistochemical analyses, N‐copine was detected mainly in the cell bodies and dendrites in the neurons, whereas presynaptic proteins such as synaptotagmin I and rab3A were detected in the regions where axons pass through. In fractionation experiments of brain homogenate, N‐copine was associated with the membrane fraction in the presence of Ca2+ but not in its absence. As a GST‐fusion protein with the second C2 domain of N‐copine showed Ca2+ ‐dependent binding to phosphatidylserine, this domain was considered to be responsible for the Ca2+ ‐dependent association of N‐copine with the membrane. Thus, N‐copine may have a role as a Ca2+ sensor in postsynaptic events, in contrast to the known roles of “double C2 domain‐containing proteins,” including synaptotagmin I, in presynaptic events.",0.006818933269188025,0.5882352941176471,0.09389671361502347,0.16194331983805665

To do so, they sequentially trained human participants with 6 different visual categorization tasks that varied in structural complexity. Humans’ exceptionally strong performance on 1 of these tasks (Type 2, organized around exclusive-or relations) could not be solely explained by structural complexity, and has since been considered the hallmark of rule-use in these tasks. In the present project, we concurrently trained pigeons on all 6 SHJ tasks. Our results revealed that the structural complexity of the tasks was highly correlated with group-level performance. Nevertheless, we observed notable individual differences in performance. Two extensions of a prominent categorization model, ALCOVE (Kruschke, 1992), suggested that disparities in the discriminability of the dimensions used to construct the experimental stimuli could account for these differences.

95,42916569,"congenital central hypoventilation syndrome sufferers have polyalanine expansion mutations. dermatoglyphic pattern frequency, left/right symmetry, and genotype/phenotype correlation assessed. results suggest a relationship between PHOX2B and the expression of pattern types. the gene is a transcriptional activator in the promotion of pan-neuronal differentiation.","OBJECTIVE. Individuals with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome have characteristic variants in the PHOX2B gene (primarily polyalanine expansion mutations). The PHOX2B gene acts as a transcriptional activator in the promotion of pan-neuronal differentiation in the autonomic nervous system during early embryologic development, with a primary role in the sympathetic noradrenergic phenotype in vertebrates. Because sympathetic innervation has been hypothesized to affect the development of dermatoglyphic pattern types, we hypothesized that individuals with PHOX2B-confirmed congenital central hypoventilation syndrome would have characteristic dermatoglyphic patterning and that the dermatoglyphic phenotype would be related to the disease-defining PHOX2B genotype. METHODS. Dermatoglyphic pattern type frequency, left/right symmetry, and genotype/phenotype correlation were assessed for 33 individuals with PHOX2B-confirmed congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and compared with published control data. RESULTS. Dermatoglyphic pattern type frequencies were altered in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome cases versus controls. In particular, there was an increase of arches in females and ulnar loops in males, with the largest differences for the left hand and for individuals with both congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and Hirschsprung disease. Dissimilarity scores between the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome + Hirschsprung disease cases were not significantly different, nor were dissimilarity scores between all of the female and all of the male cases. No significant association was found between the number of polyalanine repeats in the PHOX2B genotypic category and dermatoglyphic pattern frequencies in the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome study groups. CONCLUSIONS. These results represent the first report describing specific dermatoglyphic patterning in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and suggest a relationship between PHOX2B and the expression of dermatoglyphic pattern types. An expanded congenital central hypoventilation syndrome data set to include the full spectrum of PHOX2B mutations is necessary to further delineate the role of PHOX2B in dermatoglyphic patterning.",0.002352058419719908,0.7272727272727273,0.10810810810810811,0.18823529411764708

However, the expression and mechanism of microRNA (miR)210HG in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. Methods: The levels of miR210HG and miR-874 were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in NSCLC tissue samples and cells. Non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 and transwell assays. Luciferase analysis confirmed the interaction between miR210HG and miR-874. Results: Here, our data showed that miR210HG was overexpressed in NSCLC tissue samples and cells. In vitro functional assays showed that silencing miR210HG blocked NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting NSCLC cell radiosensitivity and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, miR-874 was directly regulated by miR210HG. Furthermore, miR-874 expression was reduced in NSCLC tissues and cells. The miR-874 mimic could mitigate the promoting effect of miR210HG on NSCLC cell progression. The data also showed that miR210HG promoted NSCLC cell progression through miR-181a expression by targeting STAT3. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that miR210HG is associated with NSCLC cell progression by regulating the miR-874/STAT3 axis.",0.010084570851514365,0.6666666666666666,0.13756613756613756,0.22807017543859648

The mutation enhances ovulation rate and in turn litter size in Garole sheep. Garole sires were crossed with non-prolific Malpura ewes with the aim to introduce prolificacy into Garole×Malpura (G×M) crosses through FecB introgression programme. In the present study, the effect of carrying booroola allele on litter size and live body weight was analyzed. The average litter size at birth was found to be 1.87 and 1.48 in the Garole and the G×M crosses, respectively. At weaning, 6-month, 9-month and 12-month of age, body weights were not affected by the presence of booroola allele (p>0.05); however, a significant effect (p<0.05) was found on body weight at birth in G×M crosses. In Garole sheep, no significant effect of FecB was observed on live weights in any age group. The interaction between the genetic group and the FecB genotype was also found to be non-significant.

This paper presents some of the highlights of its history selected from a centennial volume published by the Society (Ehinger et al. 2008). The first international meeting of ophthalmologists was held in Brussels in 1857. Subsequent gatherings in major European cities became regular events and were attended by, among others, Swedish physicians and surgeons, who brought important medical information back to their home country. In 1900, the time was considered ripe to inaugurate a regional gathering of Nordic ophthalmologists, the first of which took place in Stockholm (Granström 1955; Ehinger et al. 2008). As in other specialties (e.g. surgery, and ear, nose and throat medicine), it was considered appropriate to instigate national Swedish ophthalmological meetings and, after some preliminaries, 17 ophthalmologists gathered in Uppsala on May 30th and 31st, 1908 (Havelius 2008). These included the four founding fathers of what was to become the Swedish Ophthalmological Society, of whom Allvar Gullstrand is now the best known, having become a Nobel laureate in 1911. However, the other three were also well known at the time. They included Johan Widmark, professor of ophthalmology in Stockholm, Erik Nordenson, who ran a private eye hospital in Stockholm, and Ernst Forsmark, who acted as the Society’s secretary and who went on to become head of the Sabbatsberg Eye Clinic in Stockholm in 1910 (Figs 1–4). Allvar Gullstrand was a most remarkable man. He had shown great mathematical ability already as a teenager, and his parents had facilitated his learning by moving from Landskrona to Jönköping, where a better gymnasium teacher in mathematics was available. Gullstrand took up medical studies in Stockholm, where his ease with infinitesimal calculus quickly led him to realize that the frequent exclusion of higher-order terms from contemporary solutions to the complex equations that describe optical astigmatism resulted in incorrect and often inadequate conclusions. In his subsequent MD thesis, published in 1890, Gullstrand’s improved handling of the equations was impressive. His feat was most remarkable because he had no local tutors or predecessors. The thesis was compact and included a small number of well designed experiments that clinically validated Gullstrand’s theoretical results (Fig. 5). Gullstrand’s thesis received the highest acclaim and he was immediately offered various academic positions. He went on to study physiological optics, for which he needed to obtain various measurements of",0.007229107815728813,0.8939393939393939,0.1475,0.25321888412017163
