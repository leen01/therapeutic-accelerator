       " 'The complications of atherosclerosis are among the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. One of the most advocated measures to prevent or delay atherosclerosis development is the reduction of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level in blood (1). Yet, even extreme reduction in the LDL-C level cannot prevent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (2). A crucial contributor to cardiovascular risk that remains in spite of aggressive lipidlowering and control of other modifiable risk factors is lowgrade inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques (3). Currently, the level of the main inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein measured by the high-sensitivity assay (hsCRP) ≥ 2.0 mg/L is considered as a factor increasing estimated cardiovascular risk (4). Large randomized controlled clinical trials CANTOS, COLCOT, LoDoCo2 demonstrated that the reduction of the hsCRP level below 2.0 mg/L with anti-inflammatory agents decreased the MACE frequency by 23-29% (5). The',\n",
       " 'hsCRP assays detect the plasma concentration of the pentameric form of CRP (pCRP), which is synthesized in hepatocytes under stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines, predominantly interleukin-6 (IL-6) (3). At sites of local inflammation pCRP binds to its specific ligand, lysophosphatidylcholine, on membranes of damaged or apoptotic cells and microparticles, as well as oxidized LDL, and undergoes dissociation to the monomeric form of CRP (mCRP) (6,7). Dissociation opens up terminal octapeptide (Phe-Thr-Lys-Pro-Gly-Leu-Trp-Pro) on the C-terminal end of monomeric subunits, giving mCRP its antigenic specificity (6,8,9). After dissociation mCRP remains predominantly bound to cell membranes (10,11). mCRP was found on circulating microparticles in blood of patients with acute myocardial infarction (12) and peripheral artery disease (13). The mCRP deposits were found in carotid atherosclerotic plaque tissue, but not in the intact vessel wall (14, 15). The mCRP deposits were localized to the',\n",

It stimulated monocyte and lymphocyte recruitment and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, macrophage and T-cell polarization into proinflammatory phenotype, promoted angiogenesis (10,16).',\n",
       " 'However, a feasible commercially available assay measuring the mCRP level in blood plasma or serum is lacking. To date, there are four published papers that describe measuring the mCRP level in blood plasma or serum (17)(18)(19)(20). In all these studies the assays were performed with enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) technique. In 2015 Wang et al. produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mCRP and developed an assay for measuring the mCRP level in blood plasma (17). The assay was used to measure the mCRP level in patients with acute myocardial infarction, unstable and stable angina pectoris (17). In 2018 Zhang et al. used the mAb clone 8C8 to measure the mCRP level in blood plasma of patients with autoimmune skin diseases (eczema, psoriasis and urticaria) and healthy controls (18). In 2020 Williams et al. used the mAb clone 8C8 to measure the mCRP level in serum of patients with acute inflammation and the hsCRP level more than 100 mg/L (19).

       " 'To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the association of the mCRP level with ultrasound markers of carotid atherosclerosis. Previously, Wang et al. measured the mCRP level in blood plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction, unstable and stable angina pectoris (17). The highest mCRP level was observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction (20.96 ± 1.64 µg/L), especially in those who died in 30 days after the event (36.70 ± 10.26 µg/L), whereas in patients with stable angina pectoris or healthy individuals mCRP was not detected (17). Zhang et al. reported the median mCRP level in blood plasma of patients with eczema, psoriasis, urticaria and healthy controls ranging from 15.   The association of the elevated hsCRP level with an increase in the degree of carotid artery stenoses, greater number, larger area and total height of carotid atherosclerotic plaques was shown in a number of studies (27,(34)(35)(36). The association of the hsCRP level with',\n",
       " 'cardiovascular risk was shown in a number of large randomized controlled clinical trials, including JUPITER, CANTOS, PROVE-IT, and IMPROVE-IT (3). The association of the elevated IL-6 level with a greater plaque number (37) and a greater CCA-IMT (38) was reported in asymptomatic individuals. The IL-6 level was associated with the cardiovascular risk in the CANTOS trial (3). The elevated VWF level was associated with the endothelial disfunction (39, 40) and higher cardiovascular risk in individuals with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (41). As it was already mentioned, the overall health status of the patients in our study was considerably mild, which may explain normal level of the inflammatory biomarkers and VWF. Moreover, the patients were prescribed statins, which reduce the hsCRP level (3). Based on the hsCRP level, the participants of this study should have been classified to the low residual inflammatory cardiovascular risk category. Yet, the mCRP level allowed to identify',\n",
       " 'individuals with higher probability of formation of new carotid atherosclerotic plaques among the study participants.',\n",
       " 'Limitations of the study\\n\\nThe main limitation of this study is the absence of baseline measurement of the biomarkers and low rate of MACE. This precludes from correct assessment of the mCRP level as a biomarker of residual inflammatory risk.\\n\\n. /fcvm. .\\n\\n\\nConclusion',\n",
       " 'Despite statin treatment, 56% of the patients with low-grade carotid stenoses and initially moderate cardiovascular SCORE risk demonstrated the increase in carotid plaque number. The patients with and without increased plaque number were different only in the LDL-C level and the mCRP level. The level of hsCRP, IL-6 and VWF was normal. The median mCRP level or higher allowed to identify individuals with higher probability of formation of new carotid atherosclerotic plaques among the study participants. The adjusted odds ratio for the formation of new carotid atherosclerotic plaques was 4.74 (95% CI 1.70-13.24) for the patients with the median mCRP level or higher. Therefore, this study for the first time shows that the higher mCRP level is associated with the more pronounced increase in plaque number and total plaque height in patients with normal level of traditional inflammatory biomarkers and initially moderate SCORE risk.\\n\\n\\nData availability statement',\n",
