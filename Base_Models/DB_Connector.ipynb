Pronounced scarring is an underlying cause of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) that can lead to blindness. Since the condition is irreversible, TS in adults has been considered a marker of past exposure to trachoma infection. The aim of this report was to estimate the population-based prevalence of TS within Amhara, Ethiopia, a region with a historically high burden of trachoma.Methods: District-level multi-stage cluster surveys were conducted in all districts between 2010 and 2015 to monitor the impact of approximately 5 years of trachoma interventions. Approximately 40 households were sampled per cluster and all participants ages ≥ 1 year were graded for the 5 World Health Organization simplified signs. Before each survey round, trachoma graders participated in a 7-day training and reliability exam that included cases of TS. TS prevalence estimates were weighted to account for sampling design and adjusted for age and sex using post-stratification weighting.Results: Across the 152 districts in Amhara, 208,510 individuals ages 1 year and older were examined for the signs of trachoma. Region-wide, the prevalence of TS was 8.2 %, (95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 7.7-8.6 %), and the prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older (n = 110,137) was 12.6 % (95 % CI: 12.0-13.3 %). District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older ranged from 0.9 to 36.9 % and was moderately correlated with district prevalence of TT (r = 0.31; P < 0.001). The prevalence of TS increased with age, reaching 22.4 % among those ages 56 to 60 years and 24.2 % among those ages 61 to 65 years. Among children ages 1 to 15 years TS prevalence was 2.2 % (95 % CI: 1.8-2.8 %), increased with age (P < 0.001), and 5 % of individuals with TS also had trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI).Conclusions: These results suggest that Amhara has had a long history of trachoma exposure and that a large population remains at risk for developing TT. It is promising, however, that children, many born after interventions began, have low levels of TS compared to other known trachoma-hyperendemic areas.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nTrachoma is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Repeated infection and the associated conjunctival inflammation throughout childhood can initiate a scarring process. Conjunctival scarring is a proinflammatory and remodeling response, characterized by disordered subepithelial connective tissue, which can appear as fibrotic bands or sheets [1,2]. Scarring is thought to be an irreversible process and could be considered a marker for cumulative exposure to C. trachomatis infection and associated inflammation [3][4][5][6][7]. Severe enough scarring can cause entropion of the eyelid followed by trachomatous trichiasis (TT), corneal opacity, and eventual blindness.\\n\\nThe SAFE (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement) strategy targets both the early (infective) and late (blinding) stages of trachoma for elimination as a public health problem. The SAFE strategy is warranted for all districts (the administrative unit for health delivery) until the prevalence of trachomatous-inflammation follicular (TF) among children ages 1 to 9 years is < 5 % and the prevalence of TT among individuals ages 15 years and older is < 0.2 % [8]. Prior evidence has demonstrated that conjunctival scarring may still develop and progress over time, even after the prevalence of clinical signs of active trachoma such as TF and trachomatous-inflammation intense (TI) has declined [9][10][11]. The progression of trachomatous scarring (TS) and subsequent development of TT over time will likely pose a challenge for trachoma elimination and post-elimination surveillance efforts.\\n\\nRecent population-based surveys have been conducted in the Amhara region of Ethiopia to understand the impact of the SAFE strategy on trachoma [12,13]. The results of these surveys have demonstrated that the prevalence of both TF and TT remained highly heterogenous throughout the region with many districts still well above the thresholds for elimination of trachoma as a public health problem. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that considerable C. trachomatis transmission was still occurring among children ages 1 to 5 years [12]. While it remains necessary to know the levels of TF and TT for programmatic decisions around mass drug administration (MDA) of antibiotics and surgical services respectively, it may also be important to better understand the underlying pathophysiology experienced by a population continually exposed to endemic levels of trachoma transmission. Understanding the prevalence of TS may help trachoma elimination programs plan interventions to limit disease progression before it reaches the blinding stages and plan future surgical needs in trachoma endemic settings [14].\\n\\nThis report aimed to estimate the prevalence of TS from 152 district-level population-based surveys covering the entire Amhara region. Such data, though rarely reported in many survey methodologies, could provide insights into both the cumulative history of trachoma exposure experienced by this population as well as the future TT burden in formerly endemic districts. A further aim was to detail the epidemiology of TS among children growing up in trachoma endemic communities that have received SAFE interventions.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nStudy site and study period SAFE interventions were scaled up between 2007 and 2010 to reach all 152 programmatic districts encompassing the Amhara region [13,15,16]. Each district received an average of 5 (range 3 to 7) years of SAFE, including annual MDA with antibiotics, and eyelid surgeries to correct TT. Trachoma impact surveys were conducted once per district between 2010 and 2015 to provide region-wide trachoma prevalence estimates after the SAFE interventions.\\n\\n\\nStudy design\\n\\nThe methodology for the impact surveys included in this analysis have previously been described [12,13,16]. Briefly, a multi-stage cluster random sampling methodology was used to select the study participants for district-level estimates. In the first stage, villages were selected from each district using a population proportional to estimated size sampling method. In the second stage of sampling, segments of households were randomly selected from each village using an existing governmental administrative structure with the goal of 30 to 40 households per segment. All present, consenting individuals within the households in each selected segment were included in these surveys. Individuals aged ≥ 1 year were included in this report.',\n",
       "  'Training, data collection, and clinical assessment Before each survey round, which occurred approximately twice per year, all trachoma graders (integrated eye care workers) participated in a 5 to 7-day training [12,13,16]. Graders were required to attend training regardless of the number or date of their previous trainings. Training methods used for these surveys pre-date but were very similar to those used in more current trachoma surveys [17]. Training consisted of classroom sessions to understand the definitions of all 5 World Health Organization (WHO) simplified trachoma signs through slide-deck review, and field-based sessions focused on providing graders experience in the range of presentations trachoma signs can take [18]. Graders were then required to pass a slide-based exam, which included images of all 5 simplified trachoma signs, including approximately 5 images of TS. Graders who passed the slide exam then moved onto a field reliability exam where they were required to grade 50 eyes under field conditions. The \"gold standard\" for the field reliability exam was the consensus grade of 3 expert graders, typically ophthalmologists, ocular surgeons, or trachoma managers [16,19]. Those graders who scored an interobserver agreement of ≥ 84 % and kappa ≥ 0.7, compared to the consensus grade of the 3 expert graders for the sign TF joined the survey team [16]. Although the field reliability exam was based on grading TF, graders were also trained on how to identify and grade TS using slide training, slide examination, and field-based practice within TT surgery campaigns that were specifically planned to accommodate the graders\\' practice for these surveys.\\n\\nThe primary aim of these surveys was to estimate TF among children ages 1 to 9 years, but all study participants were examined for all 5 WHO simplified signs of trachoma, including TS. Both eyes of all study participants were examined for TS, which was defined as the presence of scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva (scars are easily visible as white lines, bands, or sheets [fibrosis] in the tarsal conjunctiva) [18]. Trachoma grading was performed using binocular loupes with x2.5 magnification under sunlight or using a flashlight. Multiple grading teams worked in each district, and supervisors traveling with grading teams spot-checked grading, particularly during the first 2 weeks of each survey.\\n\\nData collection took place on Samsung Galaxy tablets running custom-built software [20]. Data recorders were information technology or biostatistics college graduates who took a 4 to 5-day training and passed a data collection exam using the tablets. All household surveys were conducted in the Amharic language.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nAll TS prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the probability of sampling at both sampling stages. Furthermore, all TS prevalence estimates reported, district-and region-level, were age-sex adjusted with post-stratification weighting using 5-year age-sex bands from the survey census population [21,22]. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Taylor linearization and survey procedures (svy package) in Stata, version 15.1 (STATA Corporation, College Station TX, USA), to account for household and village level clustering. Most analyses were focused on individuals ages 15 years and older (standard age group used to estimate TT prevalence), individuals younger than 15 years, and individuals ages 1 to 9 years (standard age group for estimating TF prevalence) [8]. The prevalence of TS concurrent with TF and TI was also estimated. Chi-squared tests were used to evaluate TS prevalence between age group and sex. A Spearman correlation test was performed to examine relationships between TS and TT, TS and TF and TS and TI at the district level. Clustering by household and survey cluster was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of TS prevalence with a random-effects model. District-level prevalence was grouped into the categories of < 5 %; 5.0-9.9 %; 10-14.9 %; > 15 % based on the overall TS prevalence distribution.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nA total of 276,068 individuals were surveyed between 2010 and 2015 in all 152 programmatic districts across the 10 zones of the Amhara region. Among those enumerated, 75.5 % (208,510) of individuals were present and examined for clinical signs of trachoma. The majority of examined individuals, 52.9 % (110,211 respondents), were ages 15 years and older, 35.2 % (73,406 respondents) were children ages 1 to 9 years, and 53.5 % (111,577 respondents) were female.\\n\\nThe regional TS prevalence among all ages was 8.2 % (95 % CI: 7.7-8.6 %), and the TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older was 12.6 % (95 % CI: 12.0-13.3 %). The range of TS prevalence by district (n = 152) in this age group was right-skewed and ranged from 0.6 % (95 % CI: 0.1-3.4 %) to 36.9 % (95 % CI: 27.2-47.8) (Fig. 1). Each of the 10 zones had at least one district with a TS prevalence in the highest category (TS ≥ 15 %), and Waghemra and South Gondar in the central part of the region had the heaviest burden of the high prevalence districts (Fig. 2). The district prevalence of TS was moderately correlated with the prevalence of TT (Spearman correlation [r] = 0.31, P < 0.001 (Fig. 3)).\\n\\nAmong individuals, the prevalence of TS increased significantly with age (P < 0.0001); the highest prevalence was observed in adults ages 56 to 60 years ( (Fig. 4). Among individuals ages 15 years and older, TS prevalence among females and males was 15.2 % (95 % CI: 11.5-19.7 %) and 14.6 (95 % CI: 12.6-16.9 %), respectively; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.73). Among individuals with TT in this age group, 955 (23.3 %) individuals had concurrent TS, and the individual-level correlation between TT and TS was low (r = 0.0275; P < 0.001).There was some evidence of clustering at the household level with an ICC of 0.24 (95 % CI: 0.23-0.26) and little evidence of clustering at the village level with an ICC of 0.08 (95 % CI: 0.07-0.10). At the household level, 79.0 % of households did not have any adults with TS, but in 9.3 % of households all of the adults had TS. The remaining 11.7 % of households had at least one but not all adults with TS.\\n\\nThe regional TS prevalence among individuals ages 1 to 15 years and individuals ages 1 to 9 years was 2.2 % (95 % CI: 1.8-2.8 %) and 1.1 % (95 % CI: 1.0-1.2 %) respectively. Moderate correlations were observed between district prevalence TS and district prevalence of TF (r = 0.33, P < 0.0001) and TI (r = 0.52, P < 0.0001) among individuals ages 1 to 15 years. Among individuals ages 1 to 15 years, the prevalence of TS increased with age (P < 0.001) reaching as high as 10.6 % in 15-yearold males (Fig. 5). Overall, however, the TS prevalence did not differ by sex (P = 0.40) in this age group. Among individuals ages 1 to 15 years with TS, 24.3 % also had TF and 4.8 % also had TI. In this age group, the prevalence of concurrent TS and active trachoma (TF and/or TI) was 0.6 % (95 % CI: 0.4-0.9 %), while the prevalence of concurrent TS and TF was 0.2 % (95 % CI: 0.04-0.9 %) (Fig. 6).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion',\n",
       "  'Discussion\\n\\nThe results of these 152 population-based surveys suggest that the Amhara region has had a long history of intense trachoma exposure, and that a large population remains at risk for developing TT. Future monitoring of incident TT will likely be needed even after the elimination as a public health problem threshold for TT has     [13]. Furthermore, as part of TT surgical campaigns throughout the region, over 408,000 surgeries were conducted on TT patients between 2007 and 2015 [13]. Despite this, impact surveys conducted after these interventions demonstrated that many districts still had high levels of TF and C. trachomatis infection and that all but 4 districts were still above the elimination as a public health problem threshold for TT [12,13]. This continued high prevalence of TT observed in many districts may in part be due to incident TT as a result of years of progressive scarring. We found that districts with high levels of TT were more likely to have a concurrently high level of TS. Future surgical services will most likely be needed the most in districts with a high TT burden with concurrently high TS prevalence.\\n\\nIn trachoma-endemic communities, scarring starts to develop in childhood and continues to progress with age. Scarring is thought to be driven by repeated infection with C. trachomatis, whereby a higher cumulative burden of infection would lead to increased scarring [24]. It is also believed that scarring may be a result of persistent inflammation [10]. Evidence for this mechanism comes from cohort studies by which progressive scarring was observed in the absence of C. trachomatis infection [10,25]. Within adults with scarring in Amhara, 23 % had observed scarring progression over a 2-year period [10]. Within our surveys, we found that the prevalence of TS increased with age, reaching as high as a quarter of the population among those ages 60 to 64 years. Given the size of Amhara, this represents a large population at risk for scarring progression and incident TT. The Trachoma Control Program in Amhara and in other hyperendemic regions will need to develop surveillance systems to detect and operate incident TT cases. Given the within-household clustering of scarring observed in this report, the Program may expect incident TT to cluster within households as well. All communities within Amhara have received on average 5 years of the SAFE strategy including annual MDA with azithromycin. Azithromycin is an antibiotic shown to be effective against C. trachomatis and thought to also have antiinflammatory properties [26,27]. It is possible therefore that annual azithromycin distribution will reduce the progression of scarring and possibly the incidence of TT in this population.\\n\\nIn this trachoma endemic setting, TS was detectable in children, although at relatively low levels (≤ 2 %). This low TS prevalence may have been due to the annual antibiotic distribution in communities throughout the region over the last 5 years. Although pre-SAFE TS data from children in Amhara has not been previously published, in neighboring trachoma hyperendemic South Sudan, the prevalence of TS prior to the start of the SAFE strategy was 19.3 % among children ages 1 to 9 years and 31.7 % among children ages 10 to 14 years, measured using the same WHO simplified system [28]. In Guinea Bissau, a country where the TF prevalence pre-SAFE would be considered mesoendemic (22 %), the prevalence of TS among children ages 0 to 5 years and ages 6 to 10 years was 2.7 and 2.8 % respectively [29]. Although comparisons across various settings is difficult due to differences in the assessment of scarring, it appears that the level of scarring observed in Amhara among children is not reflective of a trachoma hyperendemic setting. However, children are clearly still at risk for developing scarring in Amhara since the prevalence of TF, TI, and C. trachomatis infection among children ages 1 to 9 years was still 25.9, 5.5, and 5.7 % respectively, and a statistically significant association was observed between age and scarring, even in this limited age range [12,13]. Prior studies have demonstrated that the presence of TI is associated with the incidence and progression of scarring [4,10,24,30,31]. We observed that approximately 25 % of children with TS also had TF, and nearly 5 % also had TI, therefore this subset in Amhara may be at particular risk for scarring progression. Although longitudinal studies are needed to know the degree to which scarring is still developing and progressing in Amhara, clearly, further enhanced efforts are needed to reduce the levels of inflammatory trachoma in these communities in order to reducing the burden of future scarring.\\n\\nThese surveys had several limitations. Survey teams graded TS in the field using the WHO simplified grading scheme, and therefore it was not possible to grade scarring severity. As graders were trained to identify bands or sheets that were \"easily visible,\" it is likely that mild scarring would be missed in this definition. Therefore, our TS estimates may have underestimated the total scarring burden in Amhara, and the correlation between TT and TS may have been attenuated. Evidence for this comes from a study in Amhara showing that 70 % of participants without TT, and 95 % of those with TT had had some degree of scarring using a detailed grading scheme [32]. In research settings, grading using conjunctival photographs has been common and could possibly be considered for programmatic use to allow for more granular grading of scarring. Although the field reliability test was focused on the trachoma sign TF, TS grading was integrated with the survey training, and the trainees had a chance to practice in the field along with TT identification practice that was integrated with TT surgery campaigns. This study was cross-sectional, and therefore could not measure incident or progression of TS, which would be useful indicators for trachoma programs. Currently programmatic monitoring globally no longer includes TS prevalence as an indicator, and longitudinal studies focused on scarring are uncommon [3,7,10,14,24]. The inclusion of TS estimation within programmatic surveys should be reconsidered as scarring data has recently been used to better understand the history of trachoma within treatment-naïve endemic regions and has further been used to help make MDA treatment decisions under select circumstances [6,33]. More data on scarring can also provide modelers with empirical data to improve models for the natural history of trachoma and in forecasting incident TT [34,35].\\n\\nOverall, a considerable percentage of adults have TS in these trachoma-endemic districts in Amhara, which suggests both a long history of C. trachomatis infection and the possibility of continued development of incident cases of TT in the future. Including TS data in the surveillence of trachoma may be useful for the global elimination program. Trachoma programs serving formerly highly endemic areas should continue to develop context-appropriate monitoring systems for incident TT for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nFig. 1\\n1District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015 Fig. 2 District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015\\n\\nFig. 3\\n3Scatterplot of district-level TS and TT prevalence, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an extra-auditory element that has an effect on the ability to normally follow speech and maintain a conversation. Speech in noise perception difficulty is a common complaint of the elderly. In this study, the importance of SNR magnitude as an extra-auditory effect on speech perception in noise was examined in the elderly.Methods: The speech perception in noise test (SPIN) was conducted on 25 elderly participants who had bilateral low-mid frequency normal hearing thresholds at three SNRs in the presence of ipsilateral white noise. These participants were selected by available sampling method. Cognitive screening was done using the Persian Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) test.Results: Independent T-test, ANNOVA and Pearson Correlation Index were used for statistical analysis. There was a significant difference in word discrimination scores at silence and at three SNRs in both ears (p≤0.047). Moreover, there was a significant difference in word discrimination scores for paired SNRs (0 and +5, 0 and +10, and +5 and +10 (p≤0.04)). No significant correlation was found between age and word recognition scores at silence and at three SNRs in both ears (p≥0.386).Conclusion: Our results revealed that decreasing the signal level and increasing the competing noise considerably reduced the speech perception ability in normal hearing at low-mid thresholds in the elderly. These results support the critical role of SNRs for speech perception ability in the elderly. Furthermore, our results revealed that normal hearing elderly participants required compensatory strategies to maintain normal speech perception in challenging acoustic situations.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nDifficulty in speech discrimination, particularly in challenging auditory situations such as noisy places and/or when attempting to trace fast speech, is the most common complaint among the elderly. This difficulty is often attributed to reduced peripheral hearing sensitivity in the elderly (1,2). There is evidence that speech perception in noisy situations is difficult even for normal peripheral hearing sensitivity in the elderly (3). Speech discrimination in noise depends on auditory and extra-auditory factors (4). Spatial hearing, auditory input representation in different regions of the central auditory system, and spectrotemporal cues for speech processing such as F 0 (the number of human vocal cord vibrations that are af-Med J Islam Repub Iran 2016 (9 March). Vol. 30:342.\\n\\nhttp://mjiri.iums.ac.ir fected by age and gender) are known as auditory elements for speech perception in noise (5). Cognitive system functions (as an internal element) and physical environmental characteristics (as external elements) are known as extra-auditory participating factors for speech perception in noise. Attention and memory are the most important cognitive elements that result from bottomup and top-down mechanisms (6). Therefore, auditory-cognitive system interactions are the basis of target signal and background noise segregation in the auditory system (7-12). The physical characteristics of a communicative environment are the other extra-auditory elements that influence target stimulus detection in the presence of competing background noise (13). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the most effective physical characteristic factor for speech perception in noise, and it is defined as the target stimulus power compared with the background noise power, measured in decibels (dB) (3). Several studies have supported the effect of aging on perceptual abilities. A comparison of these potencies in older and younger people revealed that older people required a 3-4 dB higher SNR than younger people to have the same proper perception under similar noise conditions. It appears that age-related changes in auditory-cognitive system functions are responsible for the requirement of an enhanced SNR in the elderly (14)(15)(16).\\n\\nMost of the studies on the speech discrimination abilities of the elderly focused on their hearing impaired abilities, clarifying the causes of decreasing perceptual ability. Pichora-Fuller et al. (17) ascribed elderly speech difficulties in noise to a deficit in central auditory processing. Clark et al. (1) and Fostick et al. (2) attributed elderly speech difficulty in noise to peripheral hearing sensitivity loss, known as presbycusis. Wong et al. (7) found that the speech discrimination ability of the elderly declined more than younger people at a similar SNR. Anderson et al. (11,15) and Sung Hee et al. (18) noted that in the elderly, a decreased speech perception in noise ability was the result of chemical changes in the central nervous system neurotransmitters.  (29) studied the role of auditory-cognitive system interactions in speech discrimination and noted inadequate results for higher SNR requirements in the elderly compared with younger people under similar noise conditions. As noted above, the majority of related studies evaluated the effects of auditory-cognitive elements on speech perception in noise of the elderly. Because of the important role of the magnitude of SNR on perceptual abilities, it appears that more studies should evaluate auditory and extra-auditory element interactions.\\n\\nAlthough it is well known that decreased hearing sensitivity and/or cognitive system dysfunction has a negative effect on the perceptual abilities of the elderly, the importance of physical environmental characteristics such as SNR has received less consideration. In this newly designed study, we investigated the role of the SNR magnitude as an extra-auditory effect element for the speech in noise perception ability of the elderly. This greatly controlled the auditory and cognitive elements legends.\\n\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nThis study was performed on 25 elderly people (16 women and 9 men) aged 65-74 years with a mean age of 67.9 (±2.45 SD) years. All individuals had normal hearing thresholds at 250-2000 Hz and were selected from three cultural centers in Tehran from October to December 2014. Safety and morality aspects of the research were approved by Iran University of Medical Sciences.\\n\\nOur study was conducted on right-handed elders with a high school diploma, monolingual with good competency in Persian as their native language, with no history of ear diseases, head trauma or accident, head surgery, depression, epilepsy, or neurological drug intake. To ensure normal hearing thresholds at low-mid frequencies, puretone audiometry was accomplished in a double-walled, sound treated audiometric booth, using a two channel calibrated clinical audiometer (Interacoustic AC40) and a supra-aural headphone (Telephonics TDH-49P). Pure tone thresholds were obtained at six octave band frequencies from 250-8000 Hz, using a 10 dB up and 5 dB down regimen according to the Hughson-Westlake method (3). In this phase, the participants had hearing thresholds of≤25 dB HL in both ears at 250-2000Hz. The mean PT average was 13.64 dB and 14.88 dB in the right and left ear, respectively. The mean high frequencies (3-8KH) hearing thresholds were 48 dB and 52 dB in the right and left ear, respectively.',\n",
       "  \"In the speech perception in the noise test (SPIN), each participant was instructed as follows. This simple test was designed to assess the ability to recognize normal words in the presence of noise. Once the stimulus presentation was heard, the heard word was repeated. SPIN was performed using four Persian, monosyllabic, phonetically-balanced, phoneme-balanced lists (n=25) based on 29 Persian language phonemes (6 vowels and 23 consonants) (31). The words were presented at a lively pace at 40 dB SL. Participants responded by repeating the heard words and an adequate response time was given to them. Compet-ing white noise was delivered at three SNRs ipsilaterally: 0, +5, and +10dB (32). Word discrimination scores were calculated based on correct repeated words by each SNR and for each ear.\\n\\nCognitive screening was performed using Persian Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test. A score>27 was defined as successful cognitive function (30).\\n\\n\\nStatistical Analysis\\n\\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS.18 software (Chicago, IL, USA). Significance was defined as p<0.05. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was utilized to verify the normal distribution of the numerical data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare word recognition scores at silence and three SNRs. Pearson correlations was used for the agerelationship study with word recognition scores in silence and at 0, +5, and +10dBs.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that data were normally distributed among all SPIN test scores (p>0.086). There was a significant difference among word discrimination scores in silence and all SNRs for both ears (Tables 1 and 2). The 0, +5, and +10dB SNRs were 0.030, 0.024, and 0.023 in the right ear and 0.034, 0.019, and 0.017 in the left ear, respectively (p<0.034). The mean of word discrimination scores in silence and at 0, +5, and +10dB SNRs were 85.07% (2.94), 64.76% (2.19), 71.82% (1.17), and 78.24% (1.78) in the right ear and 84.08% (2.84), 64.74% (2.22), 70.56% (1.60), and 78.31% (1.57) in the left ear, respectively. Moreover, we observed a significant difference between word discrimination scores for each pair of three SNRs (0 and +5, 0 and +10, and +5 and +10dB) (p<0.095) ( Table 3). There was no significant correlation between age and word discrimination scores for total in silence and three SNRs in both ears (p>0.30) ( \\n\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe main finding of this study was the significant difference between word discrimination scores in silence and at 0, +5, and +10dB SNRs in both ears. We found that the word discrimination ability in the elderly was significantly reduced in noisy conditions, and this is in agreement with Martin and Jerger (33), Pichora-Fuller et al (17), Gordon-Salant (23), Walton (24), and Doberva et al. (34) who all believed that speech perception disability by the elderly is related to non-peripheral auditory factors. With regards to the participants' normal auditory sensitivity at 250-2000 Hz and remarkable decreased word discrimination at higher noise levels, it appears that the ability of the elderly to discriminate word in noise is considerably dependent on the SNR magnitude as an extra-auditory ele-ment. Moreover, comparison of word discrimination scores in silence and at 0 dB SNR revealed that the perceptual ability of the elderly was considerably reduced at equal signal and noise levels.\\n\\nThe remarkable difference between word discrimination scores for each pair of SNRs (0 and +5, 0 and +10, and +5 and +10dB) showed that decreasing the signal level and increasing the competing noise amount extremely reduced the perceptual ability of the elderly. This finding is in agreement with Larsby et al. (35) and Tomchic and Zhongmin (36). It appears that when increasing the background noise, elderly people need compensatory strategies for adequate speech sound perception.\\n\\nNo significant correlation was found between age and word discrimination scores in silence and at 0, +5, and +10dB SNRs.   This finding is in agreement with Wong et al. (29) who found that the ability of speech discrimination in noise was not only related to the auditory system function, but also to the compensatory interaction of the auditory-cognitive systems. Therefore, one can say there is an assistive factor in the central nervous system of the elderly that prevents further speech in noise discrimination deterioration at higher ages. It appears that increased activity in general cortical cognitive regions such as the prefrontal area acts as an assistive factor to compensate for the sensory representation deficit in other cortical areas. This enhanced prefrontal activity following attention has been supported by behavioral-neurophysiologic studies (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21). The ability of speech perception in the elderly affects peripheral/central auditory, cognitive, and environmental elements. Peripheral age-related hearing loss effects on elderly perceptual abilities is caused by a reduced auditory input transition from the cochlea to the higher auditory centers. Central auditory system dysfunction resulted from processing declines at the brainstem and in higher auditory regions (15,21). Conversely, cognitive system dysfunction reduces the working memory and attention capacity of the elderly. Physical environmental characteristic deterioration reduces the speech sound transportation from the speaker to the listener (37). These factors interact and facilitate the speech message perception of the listener. Although we greatly controlled auditory-cognitive element effects by screening the elders' normal hearing at low-mid frequencies, the participants' speech perception dropped considerably even at equal signal and noise levels. It appears that reparative strategies such as prosodic rhythm tracing at the phoneme level can help reduce speech sounds transition and processing compensation. Increasing the background noise and decreasing the signal level is helpful for maintaining conversation (38,39). Moreover, the effect of auditory training to improve perceptual ability through neural plasticity in the central nervous system of the elderly is supported in various studies. It appears that acetylcholine levels increase following auditory training and is responsible for exhibitory-inhibitory mechanism interactions resulting in speech representation improvements at sub-cortical and cortical levels (40). Therefore, simple stimuli based auditory training and/or memory auditory based cognitive training (IMPACT: Improvement in Memory with Plasticitybased Adaptive Cognitive Training) (45) is the best strategy to improve brain plasticity in the elderly and improve their speech in noise perception (41)(42)(43)(44).\\n\\nRecent findings are only reliable in the frame of this research because of our small sample size. Our general findings are dependent on similar studies with adequate sample sizes. We could not eliminate the effect of peripheral high frequency loss of speech in noise perception in the elderly. Another study at 250-8000 Hz with normal hearing elders may control this effect. More audiology perceptual tests are recommended to confirm our findings. A study of the SNR effect on hearing impaired elders perceptual abilities and the effect of negative SNRs on speech perception in noise is recommended to evaluate auditory/extraauditory element interactions.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis study revealed considerably reduced speech perception ability in the presence of background noise in normal, low-mid frequencies peripheral hearing, and cognitive system function. Moreover, decreasing the signal level and increasing the competing noise significantly reduced the perceptual abilities of the elderly. It appears that the SNR has an important critical role for proper speech perception in noise for the elderly, even those who have normal peripheral auditory-cognitive function systems. According to recent findings, elderly people may need adaptive strategies such as auditory training to facilitate speech perception in the presence of background noise. \\n\\n\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nWe would like to sincerely thank the Eshragh, Andishe, Bahman cultural centers for their extensive cooperation.

       " 'documents': ['Training, data collection, and clinical assessment Before each survey round, which occurred approximately twice per year, all trachoma graders (integrated eye care workers) participated in a 5 to 7-day training [12,13,16]. Graders were required to attend training regardless of the number or date of their previous trainings. Training methods used for these surveys pre-date but were very similar to those used in more current trachoma surveys [17]. Training consisted of classroom sessions to understand the definitions of all 5 World Health Organization (WHO) simplified trachoma signs through slide-deck review, and field-based sessions focused on providing graders experience in the range of presentations trachoma signs can take [18]. Graders were then required to pass a slide-based exam, which included images of all 5 simplified trachoma signs, including approximately 5 images of TS. Graders who passed the slide exam then moved onto a field reliability exam where they were required to grade 50 eyes under field conditions. The \"gold standard\" for the field reliability exam was the consensus grade of 3 expert graders, typically ophthalmologists, ocular surgeons, or trachoma managers [16,19]. Those graders who scored an interobserver agreement of ≥ 84 % and kappa ≥ 0.7, compared to the consensus grade of the 3 expert graders for the sign TF joined the survey team [16]. Although the field reliability exam was based on grading TF, graders were also trained on how to identify and grade TS using slide training, slide examination, and field-based practice within TT surgery campaigns that were specifically planned to accommodate the graders\\' practice for these surveys.\\n\\nThe primary aim of these surveys was to estimate TF among children ages 1 to 9 years, but all study participants were examined for all 5 WHO simplified signs of trachoma, including TS. Both eyes of all study participants were examined for TS, which was defined as the presence of scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva (scars are easily visible as white lines, bands, or sheets [fibrosis] in the tarsal conjunctiva) [18]. Trachoma grading was performed using binocular loupes with x2.5 magnification under sunlight or using a flashlight. Multiple grading teams worked in each district, and supervisors traveling with grading teams spot-checked grading, particularly during the first 2 weeks of each survey.\\n\\nData collection took place on Samsung Galaxy tablets running custom-built software [20]. Data recorders were information technology or biostatistics college graduates who took a 4 to 5-day training and passed a data collection exam using the tablets. All household surveys were conducted in the Amharic language.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nAll TS prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the probability of sampling at both sampling stages. Furthermore, all TS prevalence estimates reported, district-and region-level, were age-sex adjusted with post-stratification weighting using 5-year age-sex bands from the survey census population [21,22]. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Taylor linearization and survey procedures (svy package) in Stata, version 15.1 (STATA Corporation, College Station TX, USA), to account for household and village level clustering. Most analyses were focused on individuals ages 15 years and older (standard age group used to estimate TT prevalence), individuals younger than 15 years, and individuals ages 1 to 9 years (standard age group for estimating TF prevalence) [8]. The prevalence of TS concurrent with TF and TI was also estimated. Chi-squared tests were used to evaluate TS prevalence between age group and sex. A Spearman correlation test was performed to examine relationships between TS and TT, TS and TF and TS and TI at the district level. Clustering by household and survey cluster was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of TS prevalence with a random-effects model. District-level prevalence was grouped into the categories of < 5 %; 5.0-9.9 %; 10-14.9 %; > 15 % based on the overall TS prevalence distribution.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nA total of 276,068 individuals were surveyed between 2010 and 2015 in all 152 programmatic districts across the 10 zones of the Amhara region. Among those enumerated, 75.5 % (208,510) of individuals were present and examined for clinical signs of trachoma. The majority of examined individuals, 52.9 % (110,211 respondents), were ages 15 years and older, 35.2 % (73,406 respondents) were children ages 1 to 9 years, and 53.5 % (111,577 respondents) were female.\\n\\nThe regional TS prevalence among all ages was 8.2 % (95 % CI: 7.7-8.6 %), and the TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older was 12.6 % (95 % CI: 12.0-13.3 %). The range of TS prevalence by district (n = 152) in this age group was right-skewed and ranged from 0.6 % (95 % CI: 0.1-3.4 %) to 36.9 % (95 % CI: 27.2-47.8) (Fig. 1). Each of the 10 zones had at least one district with a TS prevalence in the highest category (TS ≥ 15 %), and Waghemra and South Gondar in the central part of the region had the heaviest burden of the high prevalence districts (Fig. 2). The district prevalence of TS was moderately correlated with the prevalence of TT (Spearman correlation [r] = 0.31, P < 0.001 (Fig. 3)).\\n\\nAmong individuals, the prevalence of TS increased significantly with age (P < 0.0001); the highest prevalence was observed in adults ages 56 to 60 years ( (Fig. 4). Among individuals ages 15 years and older, TS prevalence among females and males was 15.2 % (95 % CI: 11.5-19.7 %) and 14.6 (95 % CI: 12.6-16.9 %), respectively; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.73). Among individuals with TT in this age group, 955 (23.3 %) individuals had concurrent TS, and the individual-level correlation between TT and TS was low (r = 0.0275; P < 0.001).There was some evidence of clustering at the household level with an ICC of 0.24 (95 % CI: 0.23-0.26) and little evidence of clustering at the village level with an ICC of 0.08 (95 % CI: 0.07-0.10). At the household level, 79.0 % of households did not have any adults with TS, but in 9.3 % of households all of the adults had TS. The remaining 11.7 % of households had at least one but not all adults with TS.\\n\\nThe regional TS prevalence among individuals ages 1 to 15 years and individuals ages 1 to 9 years was 2.2 % (95 % CI: 1.8-2.8 %) and 1.1 % (95 % CI: 1.0-1.2 %) respectively. Moderate correlations were observed between district prevalence TS and district prevalence of TF (r = 0.33, P < 0.0001) and TI (r = 0.52, P < 0.0001) among individuals ages 1 to 15 years. Among individuals ages 1 to 15 years, the prevalence of TS increased with age (P < 0.001) reaching as high as 10.6 % in 15-yearold males (Fig. 5). Overall, however, the TS prevalence did not differ by sex (P = 0.40) in this age group. Among individuals ages 1 to 15 years with TS, 24.3 % also had TF and 4.8 % also had TI. In this age group, the prevalence of concurrent TS and active trachoma (TF and/or TI) was 0.6 % (95 % CI: 0.4-0.9 %), while the prevalence of concurrent TS and TF was 0.2 % (95 % CI: 0.04-0.9 %) (Fig. 6).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion',\n",
       "  'Discussion\\n\\nThe results of these 152 population-based surveys suggest that the Amhara region has had a long history of intense trachoma exposure, and that a large population remains at risk for developing TT. Future monitoring of incident TT will likely be needed even after the elimination as a public health problem threshold for TT has     [13]. Furthermore, as part of TT surgical campaigns throughout the region, over 408,000 surgeries were conducted on TT patients between 2007 and 2015 [13]. Despite this, impact surveys conducted after these interventions demonstrated that many districts still had high levels of TF and C. trachomatis infection and that all but 4 districts were still above the elimination as a public health problem threshold for TT [12,13]. This continued high prevalence of TT observed in many districts may in part be due to incident TT as a result of years of progressive scarring. We found that districts with high levels of TT were more likely to have a concurrently high level of TS. Future surgical services will most likely be needed the most in districts with a high TT burden with concurrently high TS prevalence.\\n\\nIn trachoma-endemic communities, scarring starts to develop in childhood and continues to progress with age. Scarring is thought to be driven by repeated infection with C. trachomatis, whereby a higher cumulative burden of infection would lead to increased scarring [24]. It is also believed that scarring may be a result of persistent inflammation [10]. Evidence for this mechanism comes from cohort studies by which progressive scarring was observed in the absence of C. trachomatis infection [10,25]. Within adults with scarring in Amhara, 23 % had observed scarring progression over a 2-year period [10]. Within our surveys, we found that the prevalence of TS increased with age, reaching as high as a quarter of the population among those ages 60 to 64 years. Given the size of Amhara, this represents a large population at risk for scarring progression and incident TT. The Trachoma Control Program in Amhara and in other hyperendemic regions will need to develop surveillance systems to detect and operate incident TT cases. Given the within-household clustering of scarring observed in this report, the Program may expect incident TT to cluster within households as well. All communities within Amhara have received on average 5 years of the SAFE strategy including annual MDA with azithromycin. Azithromycin is an antibiotic shown to be effective against C. trachomatis and thought to also have antiinflammatory properties [26,27]. It is possible therefore that annual azithromycin distribution will reduce the progression of scarring and possibly the incidence of TT in this population.\\n\\nIn this trachoma endemic setting, TS was detectable in children, although at relatively low levels (≤ 2 %). This low TS prevalence may have been due to the annual antibiotic distribution in communities throughout the region over the last 5 years. Although pre-SAFE TS data from children in Amhara has not been previously published, in neighboring trachoma hyperendemic South Sudan, the prevalence of TS prior to the start of the SAFE strategy was 19.3 % among children ages 1 to 9 years and 31.7 % among children ages 10 to 14 years, measured using the same WHO simplified system [28]. In Guinea Bissau, a country where the TF prevalence pre-SAFE would be considered mesoendemic (22 %), the prevalence of TS among children ages 0 to 5 years and ages 6 to 10 years was 2.7 and 2.8 % respectively [29]. Although comparisons across various settings is difficult due to differences in the assessment of scarring, it appears that the level of scarring observed in Amhara among children is not reflective of a trachoma hyperendemic setting. However, children are clearly still at risk for developing scarring in Amhara since the prevalence of TF, TI, and C. trachomatis infection among children ages 1 to 9 years was still 25.9, 5.5, and 5.7 % respectively, and a statistically significant association was observed between age and scarring, even in this limited age range [12,13]. Prior studies have demonstrated that the presence of TI is associated with the incidence and progression of scarring [4,10,24,30,31]. We observed that approximately 25 % of children with TS also had TF, and nearly 5 % also had TI, therefore this subset in Amhara may be at particular risk for scarring progression. Although longitudinal studies are needed to know the degree to which scarring is still developing and progressing in Amhara, clearly, further enhanced efforts are needed to reduce the levels of inflammatory trachoma in these communities in order to reducing the burden of future scarring.\\n\\nThese surveys had several limitations. Survey teams graded TS in the field using the WHO simplified grading scheme, and therefore it was not possible to grade scarring severity. As graders were trained to identify bands or sheets that were \"easily visible,\" it is likely that mild scarring would be missed in this definition. Therefore, our TS estimates may have underestimated the total scarring burden in Amhara, and the correlation between TT and TS may have been attenuated. Evidence for this comes from a study in Amhara showing that 70 % of participants without TT, and 95 % of those with TT had had some degree of scarring using a detailed grading scheme [32]. In research settings, grading using conjunctival photographs has been common and could possibly be considered for programmatic use to allow for more granular grading of scarring. Although the field reliability test was focused on the trachoma sign TF, TS grading was integrated with the survey training, and the trainees had a chance to practice in the field along with TT identification practice that was integrated with TT surgery campaigns. This study was cross-sectional, and therefore could not measure incident or progression of TS, which would be useful indicators for trachoma programs. Currently programmatic monitoring globally no longer includes TS prevalence as an indicator, and longitudinal studies focused on scarring are uncommon [3,7,10,14,24]. The inclusion of TS estimation within programmatic surveys should be reconsidered as scarring data has recently been used to better understand the history of trachoma within treatment-naïve endemic regions and has further been used to help make MDA treatment decisions under select circumstances [6,33]. More data on scarring can also provide modelers with empirical data to improve models for the natural history of trachoma and in forecasting incident TT [34,35].\\n\\nOverall, a considerable percentage of adults have TS in these trachoma-endemic districts in Amhara, which suggests both a long history of C. trachomatis infection and the possibility of continued development of incident cases of TT in the future. Including TS data in the surveillence of trachoma may be useful for the global elimination program. Trachoma programs serving formerly highly endemic areas should continue to develop context-appropriate monitoring systems for incident TT for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nFig. 1\\n1District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015 Fig. 2 District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015\\n\\nFig. 3\\n3Scatterplot of district-level TS and TT prevalence, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015.

      "that the virus primarily targets the respiratory system and transmits via air droplets and contact. In addition to oropharyngeal swabs, the 2019-nCoV has also been detected in blood, urine, and facial/anal swabs, suggesting other potential means of transmission [1][2][3]. Among COVID-19 patients, there are more men than women [1]. Yet, although recent reports found no evidence of either sexual or vertical transmission by women infected with the 2019-nCoV [4,5], very little is known about the potential impact of 2019-nCoV infection on the male reproductive system. Of interest, bioinformatic analyses have revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor utilized by the 2019-nCoV, is abundantly expressed in the testis and male reproductive tract [6,7], raising an urgent question of potential sexual transmission through semen by men. To address this question, we conducted a study with the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Nanjing Medical University by examining the 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples collected from 12 patients in their recovery phase, as well as in testicular samples from one patient who died of COVID-19 during the acute phase.\n",

      "based on the detection of either 2019-nCoV RNA on pharyngeal swabs using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) or anti-2019-nCoV antibodies (both IgM and IgG) in serum by colloidal gold-based immunoassays, following the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China[8]. Pharyngeal swabs were collected on the admission day and every few days thereafter and processed for 2019-nCov RNA detection using the kit (Huirui Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following the WHO guidelines[8]. The recovery phase was defined as the period after viral clearance (two consecutive negative qRT-PCR tests), or a substantial resolution on chest CT scans with much lessened symptoms. The semen samples were collected through masturbation according to the WHO guideline[9]. To avoid virus contamination from non-semen sources, the process included passing urine, thorough washing of hands and penis with soap, drying of hands and penis, and then ejaculating the semen into a sterile and wide-mouthed container[9].The testes were collected from the deceased patient.Among the 12 patients in the recovery phase, nine were positive for anti-2019-nCoV IgG, but negative for anti-2019-nCoV IgM. Among the 9 IgG-positive patients, 8 showed negative pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV RNA test results while one (Patient 1) remained positive, suggesting that once IgG appears, the virus has largely been cleared. Notably, patients 9-12 displayed negative 2019-nCoV RNA test results, but their IgG remained positive during hospitalization, confirming prior infection. The deceased patient (Patient 13) tested positive for both 2019-nCoV RNA in pharyngeal swabs and IgM and IgG in serum, consistent with the acute phase of infection. At the time of semen sampling from patients 2-8, their pharyngeal swab RT-PCR test results had turned from positive to negative for at least one week who had been negative in pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV RNA tests but positive for anti-2019-nCoV IgG in their sera, were also negative in 2019-nCoV RNA tests. Of importance, patient 1 was persistently positive in pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV RNA tests even after serum IgG became positive during the recovery stage, yet his semen showed no detectable 2019-nCoV RNA, implying that the 2019-nCov does not directly infect the testis and the male reproductive tract. The deceased patient (patient 13), who died during the acute phase, tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in the testis samples, suggesting that the 2019-nCoV does not directly infect the testis or male genital tract even in the acute phase.Our data suggest that the 2019-nCov is absent from the semen and testes in men infected by COVID-19 at both acute and recovery phases. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the 2019-nCov can be sexually transmitted by men. This is the first report showing that the 2019-nCov is absent from both the semen and testis specimens of COVID-19 patients. Given the relatively small sample size, more patients are needed to confirm our findings. Multiple rounds of 2019-nCov RNA testing on semen samples would be ideal during the course of disease. However, it is impractical to collect multiple semen samples while the patients are sick. Our data also imply that the 2019-nCov does not directly infect the testis and male genital tract. A definitive answer regarding potential viral attacks on the testis will require more detailed physiological and pathological examinations of the male reproductive system of male COVID-\n",

      "Objectives/Hypothesis: To quantify the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic upon the 2020 to 2021 residency match for Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS).Study Design: Retrospective cohort design. Methods: Residency match outcomes for all applicants to our institution during 2020 to 2021 were collected from the National Residency Matching Program including medical school of origin and matched program. Matches were categorized as to home-program, within-region, or out-of-region and sorted by US geographic region. Matches from the 2020 to 2021 cycle were compared to those from 2019 to 2020, as well as averages and trends from match cycles 2016 to 2020. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and chi-square testing.Results: During 2020 to 2021, there were 436 applicants to our single OHNS program. From 2019-2020 to 2020-2021, the match rate decreased significantly for groups studied, including: All applicants(72.0% [268/372] to 64.7% [282/436]; P = .025); all US MD Senior applicants (76.5% [254/332] to 68.9% [262/380]; P = .024); and US MD Seniors specifically without a home program (77.5% [31/40] to 56.4% [22/39]; P = .046). The match rate for US MD Seniors with a home program did not change significantly (76.4% [223/292] to 70.4% [240/341]; P = .09). From 2019-2020 to 2020-2021, the proportion of US MD seniors who matched to home-program increased significantly (22.0% [49/223] to 30.0% [72/240]; P = .05).Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic saw high volumes of OHNS applicants with an overall decreased rate of matching compared to previous years. These changes particularly affected applicants without home programs. Home-program matching increased significantly, likely as a consequence of the limitations placed on in-person away experiences including interviews.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The annual residency match into Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) has become increasingly competitive in recent years. The metrics most often used to assess applicant competitiveness, primarily United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores and number of research publications, have continually increased over recent years. 1 In 2021, of the 378 US MD Senior applicants who ranked otolaryngology as their only specialty choice, 28% (106/378) went unmatched. 2 This striking proportion of unmatched applicants exceeded that of other competitive residencies such as orthopedic surgery (21.7%), plastic surgery (20.1%), and neurological surgery (19.8%). 2 These figures represent a continuation of a trend present in OHNS since 2017. The number of training positions has remained relatively stable in the specialty, with a net zero new positions added from 2020 to 2021. However, with each passing cycle since 2016 to 2017, there has been an increase in the number of applicants into the specialty. This inevitably results in a greater number of unmatched applicants each year. [2][3][4][5][6][7] The process of applying, interviewing, and matching have all been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 to 2021 application cycle, extensive policy changes were implemented in the interest of public health and to mitigate risk of spreading infection. These changes included, but were not limited to, suspension of away rotations, limitations upon travel between programs, suspension of in-person conferences and meetings, and implementation of virtual alternatives in lieu of inperson rotations and interviews. 8,9 We present 2020 to 2021 match cycle data from applicants to our institution and offer a comparison to previously published data from 2015 to 2020 in order to quantify the changes in the residency match outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

Secondary to the difficulty of access, a variety of techniques have been described. The surgical techniques described in the literature include transmalleolar access windows, medial and anterior tibial osteotomies, and resection osteotomies (plafondoplasty). The purpose of this article is to describe the surgical technique for the bi-planar chevron osteotomy of the medial malleolus. This osteotomy can provide full exposure to the entire medial aspect of the talus. The orientation of the osteotomy allows for perpendicular placement of instrumentation on the medial half of the talus and is particularly useful for cartilage transplant procedures. The technique is reproducible and has a low complication rate when performed correctly.\n"
