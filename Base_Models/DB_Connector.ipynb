Despite therapeutic advancements the mortality rate of cancer is continuously increasing. Thus, it is important to identify and design potential therapeutic agents which can specifically bind with most common targets of cancer and inhibit tumor progression. The present work discloses the potential therapeutic application of the novel 3,4-diaryl 1H-pyrazoles as prospective anti-cancerous agent. The in silico molecular docking studies performed with 3,4-disubstituted pyrazoles as ligand with targets including DNA, BCL-2 and F1-ATP Synthase revealed strong binding affinity with DNA (-7.5 kcal/mol), BCL-2 (-8.1 kcal/ mol) and F1-ATP Synthase (-7.2 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the in silico finding was validated with the in vitro cytotoxicity assay with human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231). MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 3,4-diarylpyrazole resulted in an increase in annexin-V positive cells, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3. Taken together, this study demonstrate that a novel synthesized 3,4-diarylpyrazoles, showed strong binding affinity against DNA, antiproliferative activity and executed apoptosis through ROS-dependent caspase-3-mediated mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway against MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism (s) by which 3,4-diarylpyrazoles can exert their anticancer activity and may contribute towards development of novel therapeutic agent against breast cancer.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nIn general, the naturally occurring heterocyclic compounds along with their synthetic analogues are found to display a vast variety of biological activities [1,2,3,4]. N-heterocycles such as functionalized pyroles, pyrimidines, pyridine, pyrazoles etc. are important bio-active heterocyclic scaffolds which are prevalent in nature and known to exhibit wide range of biological activities. The immense therapeutic importance of the N-heterocycles are evidenced by their presence as key pharmacophore in the major proportion of the commercially available and the best selling drugs prescribed to treat a vast range of diseases. Pyrazole derivatives have exhibited potential activity against a wide range of diseases such as anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-cancerous, anti-viral and so on [2].\\n\\nSome of the marketed drugs containing pyrazole scaffolds have been shown in Figure 1. For example, pyrazole containing drug, Apixaban is one of the most prescribed anti-coagulant [5]. Likewise, Sildenafil is a very popular drug with brand name Viagra used to treat erectile dysfunction in male [6]. Celecoxib and Ruxolitinib are anti-inflammatory and anti-cancerous drugs respectively containing pyrazole scaffolds [7,8]. Apart from these examples, various other pyrazole based drugs are known in the literature and available in the market also [4]. In addition to that several research groups are involved in the synthesis of new pyrazole derivatives and exploration of their biological activities. For example, Liang and co-workers synthesized 4-Amino-(1H)-pyrazole derivatives and explored their efficacy as JAKs inhibitor comparable and some were found to be more potent than Ruxolitinib which is an approved anti-cancerous drugs [9]. Several other such novel pyrazoles derivatives are known to exhibit anti-cancerous activities [10]. Encouraged by the several such reports available in the literature about the effectiveness of pyrazole derivatives as potential anti-cancerous agents, the work reported herein explores the potential anti-cancerous activity of novel 3,4-diaryl pyrazoles.\\n\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\n\\nSynthesis of 3,4-diarylpyrazoles\\n\\nThe 3,4-diarylpyrazoles was synthesized as described in detail earlier [4], following the reaction sequence presented in Figure 2 [4]. In detail, 3-trifloxychromone and triarylbismuths were used for the one-pot synthesis of 3,4-diarylpyrazoles as per described protocol [11,12,13]. Silica gel (100-200 mesh) was used for the isolation and purification of the final products. For thin layer chromatography, GF-254 silica gel (Merck) was used. In order to characterize the structure of the 3,4-diarylpyrazoles, JEOL-400 MHz (JNM ECS-400) spectrometer was used to record 1 H and 13 C NMR. Structures of the 3,4-diarylpyrazole were further confirmed through HRMS measurement using WATERS-Q-T of Premier-HAB213 and WATERS GCT Premier-CAB155 instruments. IR of the final products was measured using Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spectrometer. Standard drying procedures were followed to obtain dry solvents to be used for reaction and purification purposes.\\n\\n\\nIn silico molecular docking studies\\n\\nIn order to investigate the potential anti-cancerous activity of these aryalted pyrazoles, molecular docking studies were performed. During the period of docking, the DNA & proteins were considered to be rigid and ligands were considered to be flexible. The configuration file for the grid parameters was generated using Auto Grid [14]. The docking study was also used to predict the type of amino acids in the active site of the proteins which interact with the diarylpyrazoles. The results less than 1.0 Å in positional root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) were considered ideal and clustered together for finding the favourable binding. In order to perform the molecular docking study, the ligands i.e. 3,4-diarylpyrazoles were prepared using Chem Sketch [15]. These were further converted into the PDB format from the file format of sdf with the help of Open Babel software [16]. In order to simplify the further analysis, ligands were converted to PDBQT format using the graphical user interface version of Autodock Tool 4 (ADT) [14]. Similarly, the atomic coordinates of the DNA (PDB ID-1D66), BCL-2 (PDB ID-1G5M) and F1-ATP Synthase (PDB ID-1BSN) were downloaded from the RCSB PDB database. Before docking, charges, solvation parameters and fragmental volumes to the DNA, BCL-2 and F1-ATP Synthase were assigned using the Autodock Tool 4 (ADT). Further, to simplify the analysis, the DNA and proteins were also saved to PDBQT format.\\n\\n\\nBiological studies\\n\\nEncouraged by the results from molecular docking study which revealed considerable binding affinity of pyrazole derivative with the targets; this compound was further taken forward to investigate its efficacy as potential anti-cancerous agent. Chemicals used for these studies were procured from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise. The cell line (MDA-MB-231; human breast cancer) was procured from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India.',\n",
       "  \"Preparation of culture medium and working concentration of synthesized 3,4-diarylpyrazoles\\n\\nThe cells were maintained in high glucose containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) fortified with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). To get the working concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 180 and 250 μM), stock solution (10 mM in DMSO) of synthesized 3,4diarylpyrazoles were diluted in a freshly prepared working DMEM. The osmolarity (290 AE 5 mOsmol) and pH 7.2 AE 0.10 of the culture medium did not change after adding 3,4-diarylpyrazoles. The culture medium without 3,4-diarylpyrazoles was used as control.\\n\\n\\nMTT assay\\n\\nTo examine cytotoxicity of synthesized 3,4-diarylpyrazoles, the colorimetric MTT metabolic assay were performed. In this study, MDA-     \\n\\n\\nAnalysis of ROS level\\n\\nTo examine whether apoptosis is mediated by ROS production, after  \\n\\n\\nAssessment of mitochondrial membrane potential\\n\\nThe mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed using flurochrome reporter JC-1 (1μM) dye (5,5,6,6-tetra-chloro-1,1,3,3-tetraethyl-benz-imidazolo-carbocyanine iodide) (BD Bioscience) as per manufacture's instruction. In brief, cells were treated with 3,4-diarylpyrazoles (50 μM) for 24 h and then cells were incubated with JC-1 dye (1μM) for 10 min. Photographs were taken using an inverted fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL, Life technologies) and imaged first under red filter and then under green filter. Red fluorescence indicated cells with intact mitochondria while green fluorescence indicated cells with depolarized mitochondria. Values are expressed as total red CTCF from three replicates.\\n\\n\\nImmunocytochemistry of Bcl 2 and caspase 3\\n\\nThe immunocytochemistry was performed to detect the protein expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl 2 and apoptotic protein caspase3 in treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Briefly, 3,4-diarylpyrazoles (50 μM) treated MDA-MB-231 cells were fixed using 4% para-formaldehyde for 10 min, after PBS wash, cells were incubated with sodium citrate buffer for 30 min. To avoid background staining, the cells incubated with 5% blocking serum for 20 min. After PBS wash, cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies Bcl 2 and caspase3 (1:200; Santacruze Biotechnology, Inc) overnight at 4 C. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, and then incubate with texas red anti-mouse (1:800) secondary antibodies for 2h at 37 C. The photographs were captured using inverted fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL, LifeTechnologies).\\n\\n\\nReal-time PCR (quantitative qPCR)\\n\\nThe quantitative real-time PCR was performed to examine mRNA expression level of apoptotic genes (Caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl 2 ) in 3,4-diarylpyrazoles (50 μM) treated MDA-MB-231 cells. The primer sequence of genes which used in this study was shown in Table 1. In brief, after 24 h s of treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested, total RNA was isolated through trizol reagent and reverse transcribed according to manufacturer's protocol (Thermo scientific). qPCR was then performed with SYBR green dye using Applied Biosystems™Real-Time PCR Instruments (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's instruction. The changes in mRNA expression level were calculated using the Relative Quantity (RQ) equation, RQ ¼ 2-ΔΔ CT; where delta cycle threshold (ΔCT) denoted a difference in CT values between the target gene and GAPDH, and ΔΔCT signified the differences in the ΔCT value of treated sets compared to control.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nData obtained in this study were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) and expressed as means AE SEM from three experiments. The ImageJ software (version 1.44 from the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, USA) was used to analyze intensity of fluorescence. A probability of p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\\n\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\n\\nPreparation of 3,4-diarylpyrazoles\\n\\nThe 3,4-diarylpyrazoles used to study their prospective anticancerous properties were earlier synthesized by Kumar et. al [4]. following the reaction protocol shown in Figure 2. The synthesis involves the in situ formation of isoflavones under Pd-catalyzed reaction cross-coupling method performed with 3-trifloxychromone and triarylbismuth followed by reaction with hydrazine hydrate to furnish phenol substituted C-arylated pyrazoles in one pot operation in good to excellent yield.\\n\\n\\nMolecular docking studies\\n\\nAmong all the ligands, 2-(4-(naphthalen-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl) phenol (1.6) showed strong binding affinity with DNA (-7.5 kcal/mol), BCL-2 (-8.1 kcal/mol) and F1-ATP Synthase (-7.2 kcal/mol) ( Table 2). Whereas the known BCL-2 inhibitor, Navitoclax showed -8.9 kcal/mol binding affinity with BCL-2 ( Figure 3), which is close to the diarylpyrazoles. The top ten docking result generated using Autodock-Vina, which showed best binding conformations of the ligands with receptors at their active site. In past few years, the molecular docking studies have extensively been used as an imperative tool in the area of drug discovery as it allows to investigate the probable non-covalent interactions between the ligands which are generally small molecules and macromolecules such as proteins, enzymes, DNA etc. as targets [18]. Using the command line version of Autodock Vina [19] molecular docking study was also performed in present case to realize the effect of functionalized pyrazoles on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through their binding interaction with DNA, BCL-2 and F1-ATP Synthase ( Table 2). The 3D view of DNA, BCL-2 and F1-ATP Synthase with ligand interactions of the best confirmation created by ADT are shown in molecular surface representation ( Figure 3). As clearly shown in Figure 3, the establishment of important interactions between ligand and the amino acid residues which are involved in the catalytic mechanism of ROS generation through DNA, BCL-2 and F1-ATP Synthase. The protein-ligand complex is stabilized mainly by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. The top docked confirmation generated by each docking showed well established interaction with one or more amino acids at the catalytic domains of DNA and proteins. The top-ranked pose with lowest binding affinities is generally used as a standard selection in most of the docking programs.\\n\\n\\nBiological studies\",\n",
       "  'Biological studies\\n\\nWe investigated whether the synthesized 3,4-diarylpyrazoles exert anticancer activity against breast cancer, and if so, via what mechanism. Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers in women world-wide. From last once decade, several medical interventions like surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been used to treat breast cancer [20,21]. Over the past several years, many of the chemical compounds having N-heterocycles such as pyridine, triazole, pyrazole, pyrimidines scaffolds along with O-heterocycles such as benzofuran, coumarin, chromones etc have increased significant notice because of their safety, efficacy, low-cost, and therapeutical potential against cancers. As shown in Figure 4, the metabolic activity of MDA-MB-231 cells were inhibited by 3,4-diarylpyrazoles in a dose dependent manner. We found half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 3,4-diarylpyrazoles was 50 μM after 24h. Further, to examine whether the cytotoxic effect of 3,4-diarylpyrazoles in MDA-MB-231 cells was associated with apoptosis induction, various assays has been conducted. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, the 3,4-diarylpyrazoles induces morphological features of apoptosis as it increased population of PI positive cells (early apoptosis) in AO/PI dual-staining assay and also increased the number of Annexin-V/PI positive cells (late apoptotic cells) in FACS assay as compared to respective control. Our results suggest that the synthesized compound possess tremendous capacity to inhibit proliferation and induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, to assess the status of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in response to 3,4-diarylpyrazoles treatment, the cells were stained with JC-1 fluorochrome. High fluorescence intensity (higher JC-1 green fluroscence) was observed in treated cells which is indicative of depolarized ΔΨm state of mitochondria ( Figure 6). This result suggests that 3,4-diarylpyrazoles induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization may associated with increase of oxidative stress or/reactive oxygen species (ROS).\\n\\nIt has already been demonstrated that many cytotoxic agents/compounds inhibits growth of tumor through ROS dependent activation of apoptosis [22]. It has also been shown that increased level of ROS in cancer cells in response to phytochemicals eventually leads to cell death [23]. In present study, to examine whether 3,4-diarylpyrazoles induced apoptosis is mediated by production of ROS. Intracellular ROS level was analyzed in 3,4-diarylpyrazoles treated and untreated cells using a fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. As shown in Figure 7, significantly increased DCFDA fluorescence intensity was observed at 50 μM of 3, 4-diarylpyrazoles as compared to control (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the co-treatment of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) which protects cells against ROS-induced damage, almost suppressed the 3,4-diarylpyrazoles induced ROS generation in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 7). Lower fluorescence intensity was observed in combination with NAC þ3,4-diarylpyrazoles as It is reported that apoptosis is mediated by mitochondrial ROS production which may activate both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis [24,25]. In this study, our synthesized compound 3,4-diarylpyrazoles significantly induce ROS generation in MDA-MB-231 cells, indicate that 3,4-diarylpyrazoles induced ROS-dependent intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Although, ROS-independent mechanism of cell death was also reported in some other types of cells [26,27] which suggests that some other intrinsic pathways are also involved to cell death because ROS is not always necessary to induce apoptosis.\\n\\nTo delineate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis, the expression level of BCL-2 and caspase-3 in 3,4-diarylpyrazoles treated MDA-MB-231 cells were examined by immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR. In general, the ratio of the pro-apoptotic gene (Bax) and anti-apoptotic gene (BCL-2) are detrimental factors for programmed cell death, including apoptosis. It is reported that caspase-3 is activated death proteases that  finally leads to DNA fragmentation [28]. As shown in Figure 8A, total corrected cell fluorescence intensity level of apoptotic Caspase-3 protein were found higher in 3,4-diarylpyrazoles treated UL cells as compared to level of BCL-2 protein. It suggest that 3,4-diarylpyrazoles significantly suppressed the expression Bcl 2 whereas it induced caspase-3 expression in treated MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to control ( Figure 8A). Further, quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed higher (p < 0.05) mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic gene caspase-3 whereas down regulation of Bcl 2 mRNA expression in 3,4-diarylpyrazoles treated MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to control ( Figure 8B). These results further suggest that 3, 4-diarylpyrazoles induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells via ROS-dependent caspase-3-mediated mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Figure 9).\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis study first time demonstrated that a novel synthesized 3,4-diarylpyrazoles, exerted strong binding affinity against DNA, potent antiproliferative activity and executed apoptosis through ROS-dependent caspase-3-mediated mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway against MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results may help to increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which 3,4-diarylpyrazoles inducing cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells and may contribute towards development of novel therapeutic agent against breast cancer.\\n\\n\\nDeclarations\\n\\nAuthor contribution statement P.

The protein requires insertion of zinc and copper atoms, followed by the formation of a conserved S-S bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 (human numbering), which makes the protein fully active. In this report an NMR structural investigation of the reduced SH-SH form of thermostable E,Zn-as-SOD1 (E is empty; as is C6A, C111S) is reported, characterizing the protein just before the last step leading to the mature form. The structure is compared with that of the oxidized S-S form as well as with that of the yeast SOD1 complexed with its copper chaperone, CCS. Local conformational rearrangements upon disulfide bridge reduction are localized in the region near Cys-57 that is completely exposed to the solvent in the present structure, at variance with the oxidized forms. There is a local disorder around Cys-57 that may serve for protein-protein recognition and may possibly be involved in intermolecular S-S bonds in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-related SOD1 mutants. The structure allows us to further discuss the copper loading mechanism in SOD1.\\n\\nCu,Zn-SOD 2 is a very efficient enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (1). It is a dimer in all eukaryotes, whereas in prokaryotes it exists as either a dimer or a monomer. The mature, active form of SOD1 contains, in each subunit, a copper ion essential for catalysis and a zinc ion that has primarily a structural role.\\n\\nIn the active site, a narrow channel is present that is large enough to admit only superoxide, water, and small anions and ligands such as imidazole and peroxynitrite. In the lining of the channel there is a positively charged side chain from an arginine residue (Arg-143, human numbering). The cationic residue generates an electrostatic gradient proposed to be responsible for steering the superoxide anion toward the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis of residue 143 to a neutral or ani-onic residue produced proteins with dramatically reduced or abolished activity (2).\\n\\nA peculiar feature of the mature form of SOD1 is the presence of a kinetically stable disulfide bond. Once formed, the disulfide bond is maintained in the reducing cytoplasmic environment where the majority of the SOD1 inside the cell is located. The presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds is common in secreted proteins, where their primary purpose is for protein stabilization. However, disulfide bonds are rare in intracellular proteins because of the highly reducing environment and low concentration of dioxygen in the cytosol (3,4). It has been previously shown that intramolecular disulfide bonds in intracellular proteins (like SOD1) can play more than just a structural role and have functional significance (3). The disulfide bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 is fully conserved in all SOD1 structures. This bond links loop IV, which contains Cys-57, with strand ␤8, containing Cys-146. The linkage of the secondary structure elements contributes to the stabilization of the SOD1 fold.\\n\\nThe active form of the protein is obtained when one zinc and one copper ion per subunit are bound. Although nothing is known on how the protein acquires the zinc ion, a description of the insertion of copper is available. The process is aided by a copper metallochaperone called CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase) (5,6). Yeast mutants lacking CCS express a form of SOD1 protein that is essentially apo for copper but contains zinc (5,7). However, a CCS-independent activation of mammalian SOD1 is possible (8). A mechanism of the copper transfer from CCS to SOD1 in yeast has been proposed based on the x-ray structure of the heterodimeric CCS-SOD1 complex (9). In this picture, SOD1 first loads zinc ions from an unknown source, and subsequently copper transfer takes place through the formation of an intermolecular S-S bond, involving Cys-57 of SOD1 and a Cys of CCS. The disulfidereduced, copper-depleted form of SOD1 therefore represents the state of the protein before its complex formation with copper(I) CCS (10).\\n\\nAdditionally, this protein state may play a relevant role in pathological conditions. The presence of exposed cysteine residues may modulate its ability to interact with other macromolecules and to give rise to large molecular aggregates (11). Aggregates containing SOD1 have been found in some fALS patients and in some fALS SOD1 transgenic mice and rats (12,13). The fALS pathology has been related to mutations in the protein Cu,Zn-SOD1, some of which have a tendency to form fibrils (14). An increasing number of pathological states involve protein aggregates, which represent the final state of biomolecules with altered folding properties and/or structural conformations (15). To avoid interference effects arising from Cys-6 and Cys-111 (i.e. the two other Cys present in SOD1 that are in the reduced state), we studied the thermostable mutant of human SOD1 (C6A, C111S), which is structurally and functionally equivalent to the wild type protein (16 -18) and is commonly used in the study of fALS mutants to prevent intermolecular aggregation (4, 19 -21).\\n\\nCurrently, there are a huge number of structures of SOD1 (Ͼ50, ϳ10 of which of human SOD1) deposited in the Protein Data Bank in various states (22)(23)(24)(25), including several mutants, but all with the disulfide bond intact. Therefore, the structural characterization of E,Zn-SOD1 with the disulfide bond reduced that is reported here (hereafter E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH ) is particularly meaningful as it is the first structure of SOD1 with the disulfide bond broken. It represents the step before the protein acquires copper but also a state that is emerging to be relevant in the fALS-related SOD1 mutants (11,26). Therefore, it provides useful new data on the features of SOD1.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS',\n",
       "  'MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nSample Preparation-Human asSOD1 (hasSOD1) was expressed in the Escherichia coli TOPP1 (Stratagene) or BL21(DE3) strain. The 15 N and 15 N, 13 C, 2 H-labeled protein samples were obtained as previously reported (25). The protein was isolated and purified according to previously published protocols (16). The triple-labeled dimeric hasSOD1 contained ϳ70% 2 H. Metal ions were removed according to published protocols (27), and zinc reconstitution was obtained as described in Ref. 17. The reduction of disulfide bridge was accomplished by addition of dithiothreitol. Fully reduced and empty copper protein hasSOD1 (E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH ) was prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere in an anaerobic chamber. The thiol-disulfide status of purified hasSOD1 was determined by chemical modification with the thiol-specific reagent 4-acetamide-4Ј-maleimidylstilbene-2,2Ј-disulfonic acid (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (10).\\n\\nThe NMR samples of the E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH were in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5, 90% H 2 O/10% D 2 O. The final protein concentration ranges between 1 and 1.5 mM in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol. ϳ0.6 ml of sample was loaded into high quality NMR tubes that were capped with latex serum caps in the Vacuum Atmospheres chamber.\\n\\nNMR Measurements and Structure Calculation-The NMR spectra were acquired on Avance 900, 800, 600, and 500 Bruker spectrometers. All of the triple resonance probes used were equipped with pulsed field gradients along the z-axis. The 800-and 500-MHz spectrometers were equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe.\\n\\nThe NMR experiments, used for the backbone and the aliphatic side chain resonances assignment and for obtaining structural restraints, recorded on 2 H/ 13 C/ 15 N/, 13 C/ 15 N-enriched and unlabeled E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH samples, are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The 1 H, 13 C, and 15 N resonance assignments of E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH are reported in supplemental Table S2. In total, 88% of the 1 H, 98% of the 15 N, and 80% of the 13 C have been assigned. The combined variation of the 15 N and 1 H amide chemical shifts of E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH , Cu,Zn-hasSOD1 SS , and E,Zn-E133QM2-asSOD1 SS are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. 1 H-1 H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment (80-ms mixing time) (28) was carried out to identify connectivities involving histidines of the binding sites at 298 K. All the spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR), and analyzed through the CARA program (29).\\n\\nAn automated CANDID approach combined with DYANA torsion angle dynamics algorithm (30) was used to assign the ambiguous NOE cross-peaks and to have a preliminary protein structure. Structure calculations were then performed through iterative cycles of DYANA (31) followed by restrained energy minimization with AMBER 5.0 (32) applied to each member of the final DYANA family. The assessment of the structures was evaluated using the program PROCHECK-NMR (33). The root mean square deviation values for the backbone and heavy atoms of one subunit are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. 15 N R 1 , R 2 , and steady-state heteronuclear NOEs, which can provide information on internal mobility as well as on the overall protein tumbling rate, were measured with pulse sequences as described by Farrow et al. (34). R 2 were measured using a refocusing time of 450 ms. In all experiments the water signal was suppressed with the \"water flip back\" scheme (35). Average R 1 , R 2 , and 1 H- 15 N NOE values of 0.81 Ϯ 0.10, 23.7 Ϯ 2.9, and 0.82 Ϯ 0.10 s Ϫ1 are found, respectively, at 600 MHz. A correlation time of 17.3 Ϯ 2.3 ns was estimated from the R 2 /R 1 ratio (the experimental relaxation rates are shown in supplemental Fig. S3).\\n\\nThe exchange with the solvent of the backbone amide proton was investigated through a series of 1 H-15 N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments performed over 4 days on the E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH protein previously frozen dry and then dissolved in D 2 O. Exchange with the bulk solvent in D 2 O solution was measured following the intensity of amide proton moieties in 15 N-HSQC spectra. The amide protons can be grouped in three groups: fast exchanging (the peak disappears in less than 20 min), intermediate exchanging (the peak is still present after 20 min but disappears within 10 h), and slow exchanging (the peak persists after 10 h). The behavior indicates not only solvent exposure but also the presence of hydrogen bonding, which may slow down the exchange of the exposed amide protons. This is the case for almost all residues located in regions having a defined secondary structure, as they are involved in extensive H-bond networks that stabilize the ␤-barrel structure typical of this protein.\\n\\nCopper(I) Insertion-The copper-depleted protein was added with the copper(I) complex (Cu(CH 3 CN) 4 ) ϩ in a 1:1 ratio in an anaerobic chamber. The protein was then washed extensively in the presence of phosphate buffer 20 mM at pH 5. The metal uptake of the protein was established through one-dimensional NMR spectrum in the region of imidazole NHs (10 -16 ppm).\\n\\n\\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe structure of the copper-depleted thermostable form (C6A, C111S) of human SOD1 with the disulfide bond reduced (E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH ) has been determined in solution by NMR with high resolution (root mean square deviation 0.66 Ϯ 0.14 and 1.15 Ϯ 0.13 for the backbone and heavy atom, respectively, considering the segments involved in the ␤-barrel). The structure quality and the statistics on constraint violations for the final family is shown in Table 1. The protein is in a dimeric state and completely maintains the global fold of mature SOD1 (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the breakage of the disulfide bond does not significantly destabilize the protein structure. This can suggest a functional rather than structural role for this highly conserved moiety. In addition, the backbone conformation of the region at the dimer interface (residues 53-55, 149 -151) is very similar to that found in x-ray (22,36) and solution structures (25) of human and yeast Cu,Zn-SOD1 SS . Local conformational rearrangements are found essentially only in the immediate surrounding of the two cysteines (Cys-57 and -146) involved in the intrasubunit disulfide bond. This protein region, and in particular residue 57, becomes extremely more solvent accessible with respect to the oxidized protein (Fig. 2). The solvent exposure of cysteine 57 is a peculiarity that is never observed in SOD1 structures, not even in the apo form of the protein (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S4). The presence of the disulfide bond, in fact, prevents solvent exposure by forcing the Cys-57 to reach the Cys-146 that is located within the protein core. Solvent exposure is also confirmed by H 2 O/D 2 O solvent exchange measurements. The region spatially close to the cysteine residues responsible for the disulfide bridge (residues 57 and 146) appears more exposed to the solvent. This was not observed in the structures of Cu,Zn-hasSOD1 SS and E,Zn-E133QM2-asSOD1 SS .',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, the metal binding ligands in E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH have a conformation very close to that found in Cu,Zn-hasSOD1 SS and in the monomeric copper-depleted form (24,25), indicating that the protein is ready to harbor the catalytic metal. In the active site channel of Cu,Zn-SOD1 SS , located between the electrostatic loop VII (121-142) and loop IV (49 -84), some H-bonds form a highly conserved network that is important for generating the optimal electrostatic field necessary to attract and drive the substrate toward the copper site. In the present structure most of the H-bonds are maintained with the exceptions of the copper ligand His-48 hydrogen bonded to Cys-57 via the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-61 and the catalytically important side chain of Arg-143. This is also assessed by the chemical shift perturbation of the amide proton of Gly-61 (supplemental Fig. S1). The total solvent exposure of Cys-57 located in loop IV is also reflected in an increased solvent exposure of residues 48 and 146, which are buried in Cu,Zn-hSOD1 SS . Accordingly, the relative amide protons display fast hydrogen/deuterium exchange in E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH (data not shown).\\n\\nThe conformation of Arg-143 is extremely sensitive to the position of Cys-57 (37)(38)(39). Arg-143 is located at the end of the electrostatic loop (loop VII) whose conformation greatly affects the enzymatic activity. In the dimeric Cu,Zn-hasSOD1 SS solution structure, Cys-57 is quite rigid along with loop VII. As a consequence, the side chain of Arg-143 is highly ordered and is in the optimal conformation to interact with the  The number of meaningful constraints for each class is reported in parentheses. c Medium range distance constraints are those between residues (i,iϩ2), (i,iϩ3), (i,iϩ4), and (i,iϩ5). d As it results from the Ramachandran plot analysis.  superoxide anion bound to copper. In the monomeric Cu,Zn-E133QM2-asSOD1 SS species, loop IV containing Cys-57 experiences conformational equilibria and Arg-143 moves away from copper, determining a sizable drop in SOD activity (40). In the present structure, loop IV is highly disordered due to the S-S breaking resulting in extensive disorder of the Arg-143 side chain. Consequently, the overall electrostatic field is highly perturbed. The comparison of our solution structure with that of monomeric E,ZnE133QM2-asSOD1 SS (24) reveals that the observed disorder of residue Arg-143 is not a consequence of the absence of copper but of the relaxation of loop IV due to the S-S breaking. The breakage of the disulfide bond results in a perturbed distribution of the electrostatic charges in the active site channel essential to guide the superoxide ion in the catalytic site. Two mechanisms have been proposed for copper uptake and consequent activation of human SOD1; the first requires the presence of CCS (9,41), and the second involves the reduced form of glutathione (8). The first mechanism, described in yeast, is based on the x-ray structure of the heterodimeric yeast CCS-SOD1 complex. Although a direct comparison with the yeast E,Zn-SOD1 SH-SH is not possible because of the lack of its structure in the Protein Data Bank, the present solution structure shares some specific features with that of the yeast mutant H48F SOD1 in the heterodimeric complex with CCS (9) (Fig. 3). All SOD1 residues involved in the interaction with domain II of CCS (residues 51, 114, 152) experience similar conformation in E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH regardless of the differences in the primary sequence. It has been proposed that in yeast the presence of Pro-142 and Pro-144 in place of Ser-142 and Leu-144 may account for the loss of ability to acquire copper independently of CCS (8). Because yeast E,Zn-SOD1 SH-SH has been found to be monomeric (10), we can speculate that these differences in the primary sequence destabilize the structure of this region, leading to monomerization (Leu-144 is inserted in the hydrophobic part of the protein called the plug of the barrel). The correct conformation for acquiring copper could be restored only by the formation of the heterodimeric complex with CCS facilitated by interaction with domain III. However, the complexity of the issue is demonstrated by the increased propensity to monomerization displayed by a subgroup of fALS mutants (for example G85R, D125H, L38V) that have the mutation far away from the dimer interface (11,19,26).\\n\\nIn the crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex, an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys-57 of SOD1 and Cys-229 of CCS was found. If the present solution structure is superimposed on the yeast H48F SOD1 in the heterodimeric complex, a similar distance of the sulfur atom of Cys-57 from that of Cys-229 of CCS is found (0.20 nm in the heterodimer complex and 0.28 nm in the superimposed solution structure of E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH ). This feature demonstrates that Cys-57 has a favorable conformation to form the same disulfide bond. Also, in the heterodimer complex the side chain of Arg-143 is far away from the copper site and is hydrogen bonded to the backbone of Ala-230 of yeast CCS; the mobility of Arg-143 could have the role of making its side chain available for this kind of interaction.\\n\\nOn the basis of the present structure we can speculate that the copper ion could enter in its site with the assistance of Cys-57, which, being close to the copper site, could constitute a ligand in a hypothetical intermediate (Fig. 4). Indeed, the high affinity of copper for thiol groups and the complete exposure of the side chain of Cys-57 could be significant .

Copper and zinc are represented as spheres (dark and light gray, respectively) and their sites as empty circles. Thiol groups are shown as small spheres. A hypothetical mechanism for acquisition of copper ion from CCS or glutathione (GSH) complex (shown as a thick wavy line) could take place through the formation of a metalbridged intermediate. for the incorporation of copper ion into the protein, regardless of whether this occurs through the interaction with CCS (9,41) or with other copper-containing species (e.g. copper-glutathione complex) (8).\\n\\nIndependently of the mechanism by which the copper enters the site in vivo, we have observed that E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH is able to acquire copper(I) in vitro. The acquisition of copper can, in fact, be easily monitored by one-dimensional NMR spectrum of imidazole NH protons. Supplemental Fig. S5 shows the signals originated by copper binding; the figure also shows that the spectra of Cu(I),Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH and Cu(I),Zn-hSOD1 SS are very similar (and different from E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH ), thus demonstrating that the metal enters correctly in its site. Subsequent oxidation of the disulfide bond would allow the formation of the hydrogen bond network constraining the side chain of Arg-143, making the protein fully functioning.',\n",
       "  \"Exposed cysteines can also easily form interprotein disulfide bonds, thus giving rise to aggregates. The status of the disulfide bond in fALS SOD1 mutants has not been extensively characterized, although in all crystal structures of fALS mutants such bonds are intact (42)(43)(44). However, the disulfide bonds in fALS mutants are more susceptible to reduction than wild type SOD1 (26), and it has been suggested that in some fALS mutants, fibrils are formed through intersubunit S-S bonds (11). This implies that under cellular disulfide-reducing conditions at physiological pH and temperature, the fALS SOD1 mutants are more prone to aggregation. The present structure provides an important piece of information for understanding the copper uptake mechanism in SOD1 and for the debate about which is the relevant form of SOD1 for the onset of the fALS pathology.\\n\\n\\nstructure elements (residues 1-153) ␤1 (3-6), ␤2 (15-21), ␤3 (29-37), B4 (41-48), ␤5 (85-89), ␤6 (94-101), ␤7 (116-121), ␣1 (131-137), ␤8 (143-152) a REM indicates the energy minimized family of 30 structures, ͗REM͘ is the energy-minimized mean structure obtained from the coordinates of the individual REM structures. b\\n\\nFIGURE 1 .\\n1Solution structure of E,Zn-hasSOD1 SH-SH .

       " 'documents': ['Training, data collection, and clinical assessment Before each survey round, which occurred approximately twice per year, all trachoma graders (integrated eye care workers) participated in a 5 to 7-day training [12,13,16]. Graders were required to attend training regardless of the number or date of their previous trainings. Training methods used for these surveys pre-date but were very similar to those used in more current trachoma surveys [17]. Training consisted of classroom sessions to understand the definitions of all 5 World Health Organization (WHO) simplified trachoma signs through slide-deck review, and field-based sessions focused on providing graders experience in the range of presentations trachoma signs can take [18]. Graders were then required to pass a slide-based exam, which included images of all 5 simplified trachoma signs, including approximately 5 images of TS. Graders who passed the slide exam then moved onto a field reliability exam where they were required to grade 50 eyes under field conditions. The \"gold standard\" for the field reliability exam was the consensus grade of 3 expert graders, typically ophthalmologists, ocular surgeons, or trachoma managers [16,19]. Those graders who scored an interobserver agreement of ≥ 84 % and kappa ≥ 0.7, compared to the consensus grade of the 3 expert graders for the sign TF joined the survey team [16]. Although the field reliability exam was based on grading TF, graders were also trained on how to identify and grade TS using slide training, slide examination, and field-based practice within TT surgery campaigns that were specifically planned to accommodate the graders\\' practice for these surveys.\\n\\nThe primary aim of these surveys was to estimate TF among children ages 1 to 9 years, but all study participants were examined for all 5 WHO simplified signs of trachoma, including TS. Both eyes of all study participants were examined for TS, which was defined as the presence of scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva (scars are easily visible as white lines, bands, or sheets [fibrosis] in the tarsal conjunctiva) [18]. Trachoma grading was performed using binocular loupes with x2.5 magnification under sunlight or using a flashlight. Multiple grading teams worked in each district, and supervisors traveling with grading teams spot-checked grading, particularly during the first 2 weeks of each survey.\\n\\nData collection took place on Samsung Galaxy tablets running custom-built software [20]. Data recorders were information technology or biostatistics college graduates who took a 4 to 5-day training and passed a data collection exam using the tablets. All household surveys were conducted in the Amharic language.\\n\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nAll TS prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the probability of sampling at both sampling stages. Furthermore, all TS prevalence estimates reported, district-and region-level, were age-sex adjusted with post-stratification weighting using 5-year age-sex bands from the survey census population [21,22]. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Taylor linearization and survey procedures (svy package) in Stata, version 15.1 (STATA Corporation, College Station TX, USA), to account for household and village level clustering. Most analyses were focused on individuals ages 15 years and older (standard age group used to estimate TT prevalence), individuals younger than 15 years, and individuals ages 1 to 9 years (standard age group for estimating TF prevalence) [8]. The prevalence of TS concurrent with TF and TI was also estimated. Chi-squared tests were used to evaluate TS prevalence between age group and sex. A Spearman correlation test was performed to examine relationships between TS and TT, TS and TF and TS and TI at the district level. Clustering by household and survey cluster was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of TS prevalence with a random-effects model. District-level prevalence was grouped into the categories of < 5 %; 5.0-9.9 %; 10-14.9 %; > 15 % based on the overall TS prevalence distribution.\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nA total of 276,068 individuals were surveyed between 2010 and 2015 in all 152 programmatic districts across the 10 zones of the Amhara region. Among those enumerated, 75.5 % (208,510) of individuals were present and examined for clinical signs of trachoma. The majority of examined individuals, 52.9 % (110,211 respondents), were ages 15 years and older, 35.2 % (73,406 respondents) were children ages 1 to 9 years, and 53.5 % (111,577 respondents) were female.\\n\\nThe regional TS prevalence among all ages was 8.2 % (95 % CI: 7.7-8.6 %), and the TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older was 12.6 % (95 % CI: 12.0-13.3 %). The range of TS prevalence by district (n = 152) in this age group was right-skewed and ranged from 0.6 % (95 % CI: 0.1-3.4 %) to 36.9 % (95 % CI: 27.2-47.8) (Fig. 1). Each of the 10 zones had at least one district with a TS prevalence in the highest category (TS ≥ 15 %), and Waghemra and South Gondar in the central part of the region had the heaviest burden of the high prevalence districts (Fig. 2). The district prevalence of TS was moderately correlated with the prevalence of TT (Spearman correlation [r] = 0.31, P < 0.001 (Fig. 3)).\\n\\nAmong individuals, the prevalence of TS increased significantly with age (P < 0.0001); the highest prevalence was observed in adults ages 56 to 60 years ( (Fig. 4). Among individuals ages 15 years and older, TS prevalence among females and males was 15.2 % (95 % CI: 11.5-19.7 %) and 14.6 (95 % CI: 12.6-16.9 %), respectively; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.73). Among individuals with TT in this age group, 955 (23.3 %) individuals had concurrent TS, and the individual-level correlation between TT and TS was low (r = 0.0275; P < 0.001).There was some evidence of clustering at the household level with an ICC of 0.24 (95 % CI: 0.23-0.26) and little evidence of clustering at the village level with an ICC of 0.08 (95 % CI: 0.07-0.10). At the household level, 79.0 % of households did not have any adults with TS, but in 9.3 % of households all of the adults had TS. The remaining 11.7 % of households had at least one but not all adults with TS.\\n\\nThe regional TS prevalence among individuals ages 1 to 15 years and individuals ages 1 to 9 years was 2.2 % (95 % CI: 1.8-2.8 %) and 1.1 % (95 % CI: 1.0-1.2 %) respectively. Moderate correlations were observed between district prevalence TS and district prevalence of TF (r = 0.33, P < 0.0001) and TI (r = 0.52, P < 0.0001) among individuals ages 1 to 15 years. Among individuals ages 1 to 15 years, the prevalence of TS increased with age (P < 0.001) reaching as high as 10.6 % in 15-yearold males (Fig. 5). Overall, however, the TS prevalence did not differ by sex (P = 0.40) in this age group. Among individuals ages 1 to 15 years with TS, 24.3 % also had TF and 4.8 % also had TI. In this age group, the prevalence of concurrent TS and active trachoma (TF and/or TI) was 0.6 % (95 % CI: 0.4-0.9 %), while the prevalence of concurrent TS and TF was 0.2 % (95 % CI: 0.04-0.9 %) (Fig. 6).\\n\\n\\nDiscussion',\n",
       "  'Discussion\\n\\nThe results of these 152 population-based surveys suggest that the Amhara region has had a long history of intense trachoma exposure, and that a large population remains at risk for developing TT. Future monitoring of incident TT will likely be needed even after the elimination as a public health problem threshold for TT has     [13]. Furthermore, as part of TT surgical campaigns throughout the region, over 408,000 surgeries were conducted on TT patients between 2007 and 2015 [13]. Despite this, impact surveys conducted after these interventions demonstrated that many districts still had high levels of TF and C. trachomatis infection and that all but 4 districts were still above the elimination as a public health problem threshold for TT [12,13]. This continued high prevalence of TT observed in many districts may in part be due to incident TT as a result of years of progressive scarring. We found that districts with high levels of TT were more likely to have a concurrently high level of TS. Future surgical services will most likely be needed the most in districts with a high TT burden with concurrently high TS prevalence.\\n\\nIn trachoma-endemic communities, scarring starts to develop in childhood and continues to progress with age. Scarring is thought to be driven by repeated infection with C. trachomatis, whereby a higher cumulative burden of infection would lead to increased scarring [24]. It is also believed that scarring may be a result of persistent inflammation [10]. Evidence for this mechanism comes from cohort studies by which progressive scarring was observed in the absence of C. trachomatis infection [10,25]. Within adults with scarring in Amhara, 23 % had observed scarring progression over a 2-year period [10]. Within our surveys, we found that the prevalence of TS increased with age, reaching as high as a quarter of the population among those ages 60 to 64 years. Given the size of Amhara, this represents a large population at risk for scarring progression and incident TT. The Trachoma Control Program in Amhara and in other hyperendemic regions will need to develop surveillance systems to detect and operate incident TT cases. Given the within-household clustering of scarring observed in this report, the Program may expect incident TT to cluster within households as well. All communities within Amhara have received on average 5 years of the SAFE strategy including annual MDA with azithromycin. Azithromycin is an antibiotic shown to be effective against C. trachomatis and thought to also have antiinflammatory properties [26,27]. It is possible therefore that annual azithromycin distribution will reduce the progression of scarring and possibly the incidence of TT in this population.\\n\\nIn this trachoma endemic setting, TS was detectable in children, although at relatively low levels (≤ 2 %). This low TS prevalence may have been due to the annual antibiotic distribution in communities throughout the region over the last 5 years. Although pre-SAFE TS data from children in Amhara has not been previously published, in neighboring trachoma hyperendemic South Sudan, the prevalence of TS prior to the start of the SAFE strategy was 19.3 % among children ages 1 to 9 years and 31.7 % among children ages 10 to 14 years, measured using the same WHO simplified system [28]. In Guinea Bissau, a country where the TF prevalence pre-SAFE would be considered mesoendemic (22 %), the prevalence of TS among children ages 0 to 5 years and ages 6 to 10 years was 2.7 and 2.8 % respectively [29]. Although comparisons across various settings is difficult due to differences in the assessment of scarring, it appears that the level of scarring observed in Amhara among children is not reflective of a trachoma hyperendemic setting. However, children are clearly still at risk for developing scarring in Amhara since the prevalence of TF, TI, and C. trachomatis infection among children ages 1 to 9 years was still 25.9, 5.5, and 5.7 % respectively, and a statistically significant association was observed between age and scarring, even in this limited age range [12,13]. Prior studies have demonstrated that the presence of TI is associated with the incidence and progression of scarring [4,10,24,30,31]. We observed that approximately 25 % of children with TS also had TF, and nearly 5 % also had TI, therefore this subset in Amhara may be at particular risk for scarring progression. Although longitudinal studies are needed to know the degree to which scarring is still developing and progressing in Amhara, clearly, further enhanced efforts are needed to reduce the levels of inflammatory trachoma in these communities in order to reducing the burden of future scarring.\\n\\nThese surveys had several limitations. Survey teams graded TS in the field using the WHO simplified grading scheme, and therefore it was not possible to grade scarring severity. As graders were trained to identify bands or sheets that were \"easily visible,\" it is likely that mild scarring would be missed in this definition. Therefore, our TS estimates may have underestimated the total scarring burden in Amhara, and the correlation between TT and TS may have been attenuated. Evidence for this comes from a study in Amhara showing that 70 % of participants without TT, and 95 % of those with TT had had some degree of scarring using a detailed grading scheme [32]. In research settings, grading using conjunctival photographs has been common and could possibly be considered for programmatic use to allow for more granular grading of scarring. Although the field reliability test was focused on the trachoma sign TF, TS grading was integrated with the survey training, and the trainees had a chance to practice in the field along with TT identification practice that was integrated with TT surgery campaigns. This study was cross-sectional, and therefore could not measure incident or progression of TS, which would be useful indicators for trachoma programs. Currently programmatic monitoring globally no longer includes TS prevalence as an indicator, and longitudinal studies focused on scarring are uncommon [3,7,10,14,24]. The inclusion of TS estimation within programmatic surveys should be reconsidered as scarring data has recently been used to better understand the history of trachoma within treatment-naïve endemic regions and has further been used to help make MDA treatment decisions under select circumstances [6,33]. More data on scarring can also provide modelers with empirical data to improve models for the natural history of trachoma and in forecasting incident TT [34,35].\\n\\nOverall, a considerable percentage of adults have TS in these trachoma-endemic districts in Amhara, which suggests both a long history of C. trachomatis infection and the possibility of continued development of incident cases of TT in the future. Including TS data in the surveillence of trachoma may be useful for the global elimination program. Trachoma programs serving formerly highly endemic areas should continue to develop context-appropriate monitoring systems for incident TT for the foreseeable future. \\n\\nFig. 1\\n1District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015 Fig. 2 District-level TS prevalence among individuals ages 15 years and older, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015\\n\\nFig. 3\\n3Scatterplot of district-level TS and TT prevalence, Amhara, Ethiopia, 2010 to 2015.

      "that the virus primarily targets the respiratory system and transmits via air droplets and contact. In addition to oropharyngeal swabs, the 2019-nCoV has also been detected in blood, urine, and facial/anal swabs, suggesting other potential means of transmission [1][2][3]. Among COVID-19 patients, there are more men than women [1]. Yet, although recent reports found no evidence of either sexual or vertical transmission by women infected with the 2019-nCoV [4,5], very little is known about the potential impact of 2019-nCoV infection on the male reproductive system. Of interest, bioinformatic analyses have revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor utilized by the 2019-nCoV, is abundantly expressed in the testis and male reproductive tract [6,7], raising an urgent question of potential sexual transmission through semen by men. To address this question, we conducted a study with the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Nanjing Medical University by examining the 2019-nCoV RNA in semen samples collected from 12 patients in their recovery phase, as well as in testicular samples from one patient who died of COVID-19 during the acute phase.\n",

      "based on the detection of either 2019-nCoV RNA on pharyngeal swabs using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) or anti-2019-nCoV antibodies (both IgM and IgG) in serum by colloidal gold-based immunoassays, following the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China[8]. Pharyngeal swabs were collected on the admission day and every few days thereafter and processed for 2019-nCov RNA detection using the kit (Huirui Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) following the WHO guidelines[8]. The recovery phase was defined as the period after viral clearance (two consecutive negative qRT-PCR tests), or a substantial resolution on chest CT scans with much lessened symptoms. The semen samples were collected through masturbation according to the WHO guideline[9]. To avoid virus contamination from non-semen sources, the process included passing urine, thorough washing of hands and penis with soap, drying of hands and penis, and then ejaculating the semen into a sterile and wide-mouthed container[9].The testes were collected from the deceased patient.Among the 12 patients in the recovery phase, nine were positive for anti-2019-nCoV IgG, but negative for anti-2019-nCoV IgM. Among the 9 IgG-positive patients, 8 showed negative pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV RNA test results while one (Patient 1) remained positive, suggesting that once IgG appears, the virus has largely been cleared. Notably, patients 9-12 displayed negative 2019-nCoV RNA test results, but their IgG remained positive during hospitalization, confirming prior infection. The deceased patient (Patient 13) tested positive for both 2019-nCoV RNA in pharyngeal swabs and IgM and IgG in serum, consistent with the acute phase of infection. At the time of semen sampling from patients 2-8, their pharyngeal swab RT-PCR test results had turned from positive to negative for at least one week who had been negative in pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV RNA tests but positive for anti-2019-nCoV IgG in their sera, were also negative in 2019-nCoV RNA tests. Of importance, patient 1 was persistently positive in pharyngeal swab 2019-nCoV RNA tests even after serum IgG became positive during the recovery stage, yet his semen showed no detectable 2019-nCoV RNA, implying that the 2019-nCov does not directly infect the testis and the male reproductive tract. The deceased patient (patient 13), who died during the acute phase, tested negative for 2019-nCoV RNA in the testis samples, suggesting that the 2019-nCoV does not directly infect the testis or male genital tract even in the acute phase.Our data suggest that the 2019-nCov is absent from the semen and testes in men infected by COVID-19 at both acute and recovery phases. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the 2019-nCov can be sexually transmitted by men. This is the first report showing that the 2019-nCov is absent from both the semen and testis specimens of COVID-19 patients. Given the relatively small sample size, more patients are needed to confirm our findings. Multiple rounds of 2019-nCov RNA testing on semen samples would be ideal during the course of disease. However, it is impractical to collect multiple semen samples while the patients are sick. Our data also imply that the 2019-nCov does not directly infect the testis and male genital tract. A definitive answer regarding potential viral attacks on the testis will require more detailed physiological and pathological examinations of the male reproductive system of male COVID-\n",

      "Objectives/Hypothesis: To quantify the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic upon the 2020 to 2021 residency match for Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS).Study Design: Retrospective cohort design. Methods: Residency match outcomes for all applicants to our institution during 2020 to 2021 were collected from the National Residency Matching Program including medical school of origin and matched program. Matches were categorized as to home-program, within-region, or out-of-region and sorted by US geographic region. Matches from the 2020 to 2021 cycle were compared to those from 2019 to 2020, as well as averages and trends from match cycles 2016 to 2020. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and chi-square testing.Results: During 2020 to 2021, there were 436 applicants to our single OHNS program. From 2019-2020 to 2020-2021, the match rate decreased significantly for groups studied, including: All applicants(72.0% [268/372] to 64.7% [282/436]; P = .025); all US MD Senior applicants (76.5% [254/332] to 68.9% [262/380]; P = .024); and US MD Seniors specifically without a home program (77.5% [31/40] to 56.4% [22/39]; P = .046). The match rate for US MD Seniors with a home program did not change significantly (76.4% [223/292] to 70.4% [240/341]; P = .09). From 2019-2020 to 2020-2021, the proportion of US MD seniors who matched to home-program increased significantly (22.0% [49/223] to 30.0% [72/240]; P = .05).Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic saw high volumes of OHNS applicants with an overall decreased rate of matching compared to previous years. These changes particularly affected applicants without home programs. Home-program matching increased significantly, likely as a consequence of the limitations placed on in-person away experiences including interviews.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The annual residency match into Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) has become increasingly competitive in recent years. The metrics most often used to assess applicant competitiveness, primarily United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores and number of research publications, have continually increased over recent years. 1 In 2021, of the 378 US MD Senior applicants who ranked otolaryngology as their only specialty choice, 28% (106/378) went unmatched. 2 This striking proportion of unmatched applicants exceeded that of other competitive residencies such as orthopedic surgery (21.7%), plastic surgery (20.1%), and neurological surgery (19.8%). 2 These figures represent a continuation of a trend present in OHNS since 2017. The number of training positions has remained relatively stable in the specialty, with a net zero new positions added from 2020 to 2021. However, with each passing cycle since 2016 to 2017, there has been an increase in the number of applicants into the specialty. This inevitably results in a greater number of unmatched applicants each year. [2][3][4][5][6][7] The process of applying, interviewing, and matching have all been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 to 2021 application cycle, extensive policy changes were implemented in the interest of public health and to mitigate risk of spreading infection. These changes included, but were not limited to, suspension of away rotations, limitations upon travel between programs, suspension of in-person conferences and meetings, and implementation of virtual alternatives in lieu of inperson rotations and interviews. 8,9 We present 2020 to 2021 match cycle data from applicants to our institution and offer a comparison to previously published data from 2015 to 2020 in order to quantify the changes in the residency match outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
